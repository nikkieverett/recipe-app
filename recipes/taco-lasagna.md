  I use oven ready or no-boil lasagna noodles to save time. You can use regular noodles as well, just boil them before assembling. It's important to cover it tightly when baking. This kind of steams the noodles with the salsa. Freezing: This freezes great! To use frozen casserole: Thaw in the refrigerator for 8 hours and then bake as directed.
