href: https://coupleinthekitchen.com/baked-brie-with-apples-and-pecans/
ingredients: >-
  

  *  1Brie wheel 

  * 1 granny smith apple, peeled and chopped (I wouldn't use the whole apple, it was too much)

  * 2 tbsp maple syrup

  * 4 tbsp brown sugar

  * ½ teaspoon cinnamon

  * ½ cup pecans, chopped

  * Crackers and sliced apples, for serving
directions: >-
  

  1. Preheat your oven to 350 degrees Fahrenheit. 

  2. Use a baked brie cooking vessel or any other oven-safe dish. We picked up this mini cast iron skillet and we just love how it comes with a wooden trivet. It works perfect for baked brie.

  3. Top your whole brie cheese wheel with a few pecans. The oven will help to toast the pecans as you’re cooking brie.

  4. Put the brie in the oven.

  5. Peel your apple with a vegetable peeler and then chop into small pieces. 

  6. Meanwhile, add the apples, chopped pecans, maple syrup, cinnamon, and brown sugar in a skillet. Cool for a few minutes until the apples soften and the brown sugar turns into a syrupy consistency.

  7. Once your warm brie looks puffed out and slightly melty, remove it from the oven. It will take about 15 minutes, more or less, depending on the type of brie you use.

  8. Top the warm brie with the apple and pecan mixture.

  9. Serve your baked brie with crackers, baguette slices, or apple slices. Dive in and enjoy!
