  butter, 

  roasted garlic, 

  Worcestershire sauce, 

  dry vermouth or white wine
directions: >-
  1. Start by melting a few generous tablespoons of butter in a pan over
  medium-low heat. Allow it to bubble and sizzle gently until it takes on a
  golden brown hue. This step is crucial, as it imbues the sauce with a nutty,
  caramelized richness that elevates the entire dish. 

  2. Next, add in a splash of dry vermouth, and watch the alchemy unfold. Let the liquid simmer, allowing the alcohol to evaporate, leaving behind a delicate sweetness that will balance the savory notes of the steak.

  3. Take a few cloves of garlic that have been slow-roasted and remove their paper-thin skins with a gentle squeeze. Whisk the softened garlic into the pan with the butter and vermouth, and watch as the sauce transforms into a fragrant symphony of flavors. 

  4. Finally, a generous splash of worcestershire sauce ties everything together. This umami-rich elixir lends depth and complexity to the sauce, while its subtle tanginess adds a tantalizing contrast to the richness of the butter and garlic.


  Roasting garlic mellows its pungency, yielding a sweet and earthy flavor that marries beautifully with the steak's richness. If you desire a bolder kick, you can substitute minced raw garlic, but use it sparingly to avoid overwhelming the dish. Worcestershire sauce is a flavor powerhouse. Its tangy, umami-rich profile is the backbone of the sauce. If you're seeking more umami and less tang, consider using fish sauce as an alternative, though dial down the volume, as it can be quite intense. And don't worry, in small quantities, it won't make things taste fishy.


  The dry vermouth contributes a subtle sweetness and complexity to the sauce. If you don't have or don't care for dry vermouth, you can swap it out for dry white wine, resulting in a less herbaceous but equally delightful sauce. Finally, browning the butter brings unbeatable nuttiness to this sauce, which works wonders over a seared or grilled steak. But not everyone enjoys butter, so feel free to swap out a bit of olive oil. The nuttiness will be gone, but in its place, a subtle grassiness that is not unwelcome will unfold across the sauce.
