ingredients: |-
  

  * 3 (3.4-ounce) packages instant vanilla pudding
  * 1 quart (4 cups) whole milk
  * 1 (8-ounce) tub Cool Whip
  * 1 (14.4-ounce) box graham crackers (26 to 28 graham cracker sheets)
  * 1 cup dark chocolate chips (about 6 1/2 ounces
  * 3/4 cup heavy cream
  * 1/4 cup light corn syrup
  * 1/8 teaspoon kosher salt
directions: >-
  

  1. Place 3 (3.4-ounce) packages instant vanilla pudding and 1 quart whole milk in a large bowl and whisk until smooth. Add 1 (8-ounce) tub Cool Whip and use a flexible spatula to gently fold together until well combined.

  2. Arrange a layer of graham crackers (about 1 sleeve) in 9x13-inch baking dish, breaking the crackers as needed to fit. Spread half of the pudding mixture evenly over the graham crackers. Arrange a second layer of graham crackers on top of the pudding mixture. Spread the remaining pudding mixture over the top. Finish with a third layer of graham crackers.

  3. Place 1 cup dark chocolate chips, 3/4 cup heavy cream, 1/4 cup light corn syrup, and 1/8 teaspoon kosher salt in a medium microwave-safe bowl. Microwave on HIGH in 15-second increments, stirring after each increment, until the chocolate is melted and the mixture is completely smooth, about 1 minute total. (Alternatively, heat in a small saucepan on the stovetop over low heat.)

  4. Pour the chocolate mixture evenly over the top layer of graham crackers. Smooth it out with the spatula. Cover the baking dish and refrigerate for at least 8 hours or up to overnight before cutting and serving.
