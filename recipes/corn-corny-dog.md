  1. In a large bowl, combine the first 7 ingredients. In another bowl, whisk milk and egg; stir into dry ingredients just until moistened. Let stand for 15 minutes. Insert skewers into hot dogs; dip into batter.

  2. In an electric skillet or deep-fat fryer, heat oil to 375°. Fry corn dogs, a few at a time, until golden brown, 2-3 minutes, turning occasionally. Drain on paper towels.

  **Test Kitchen tips**


  Don't forget to let the batter stand before coating the hot dogs. It thickens up a bit and clings better after 15 minutes.

  Make sure the oil temperature returns to 375° between batches.
