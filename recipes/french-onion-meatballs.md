  * 2 cloves garlic, minced

  1. **Prepare the Meatballs:**

  2. In a large bowl, mix together the ground beef, breadcrumbs, milk, egg, Parmesan cheese, minced garlic, thyme, salt, and pepper. Once fully combined, shape the mixture into 1 ½-inch meatballs.

  3. **Brown the Meatballs:**

  4. Heat 2 tablespoons of olive oil in a large oven-safe skillet over medium-high heat. Add the meatballs and cook for about 6-8 minutes, turning occasionally to brown them on all sides. Once browned, transfer the meatballs to a plate and set aside.

  5. **Caramelize the Onions:**

  6. Reduce the heat to medium-low and add butter and olive oil to the same skillet. Toss in the sliced onions and salt, stirring frequently. Cook until the onions are soft and caramelized, about 25-30 minutes. This slow-cooking process gives the onions their deep, sweet flavor.

  7. **Create the Sauce:**

  8. Add the minced garlic to the onions and cook for an additional minute. Sprinkle in the flour and stir constantly for about a minute, allowing the raw flour taste to cook out. Pour in the sherry or white wine, simmering until it’s nearly evaporated, about 1 minute. Then, stir in the beef broth and thyme leaves, bringing the sauce to a gentle simmer.

  9. **Combine Meatballs and Sauce:**

  10. Nestle the browned meatballs into the sauce, ensuring they’re evenly distributed. Sprinkle Gruyère and mozzarella cheese generously over the meatballs.

  11. **Broil to Perfection:**

  12. Preheat your oven's broiler to high. Place the skillet under the broiler for 2-3 minutes or until the cheese is melted and bubbly.

  13. **Serve Hot:**

  14. Garnish with fresh thyme and serve these French Onion Meatballs piping hot. Pair with crusty bread to soak up all that delicious sauce, or serve over mashed potatoes for a full meal.

  * **Patience with Onions:** The key to this recipe’s depth of flavor is in the caramelized onions. Don’t rush this step! Give the onions plenty of time to slowly cook and develop their natural sweetness.

  * **Cheese Perfection:** For an extra bubbly and golden topping, make sure your oven is fully preheated before broiling the cheese. Keep an eye on it to avoid burning.
