directions: >-
  1. In a large mixing bowl whisk the flour, sugar and salt until combined. Then
  create a well with flour and add the eggs. Gradually pour in milk, whisking to
  combine after each addition. Let batter stand at room temperature until
  slightly bubbly on top, 15 to 20 minutes.

  2. While batter sits, prepare filling and fruit.  Put fruit in a small pot to boil.

  3. Beat the cream cheese, sugar and vanilla until smooth. Then mix in the pre-made (or store bought) whipped cream. Mix just until smooth.

  4. MAKE SURE PAN IS HOT ENOUGH BEFORE PUTTING BATTER IN.  In a small skillet over medium heat, melt butter. About 1/4 cup at a time, drop batter evenly onto pan, swirling it to evenly coat.

  5. Cook 2 minutes, then flip and cook 1 minute more. Repeat with remaining batter.

  6. Assemble crepes putting 1 T cream cheese mixture in each and rolling.  Top with fruit.  Dust with powdered sugar.
