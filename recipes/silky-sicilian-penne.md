ingredients: |-
  * 2 chicken breasts - sliced
  * 1 Zucchini
  * 4 ounce Cremini Mushrooms
  * 4 ounce Grape Tomatoes
  * ¼ ounce Chives
  * 1 Lemon
  * 6 ounce Penne Pasta
  * 1 teaspoon Italian Seasoning
  * 1 Mushroom Stock Concentrate
  * 4 tablespoon Creme Fraiche
  * ¼ cup Parmesan Cheese
  * 4 teaspoon Olive Oil
  * 2 tablespoon Butter
  * Salt
  * Pepper
directions: >-
  * Bring a large pot of salted water to boil. 

  * Season chicken.  Heat a drizzle of olive oil in a large pan over medium-high heat. Saute in chicken until cooked through, about 10 minutes.  Transfer to a medium bowl.

  * Wash and dry all produce. Trim and quarter zucchini lengthwise; cut crosswise into ½-inch-thick pieces. Trim and thinly slice mushrooms. Halve tomatoes. Mince chives. Quarter lemon.

  * Heat another drizzle of olive oil in the large pan over medium-high heat. Add zucchini and season with salt and pepper. Cook, stirring occasionally, until golden brown and softened, 4-6 minutes. Set aside with chicken.

  * Heat a large drizzle of olive oil in pan used for zucchini over medium-high heat. Add mushrooms and cook, stirring occasionally, until golden brown and slightly crispy, 5-7 minutes. Turn off heat; season with salt and pepper, then transfer to bowl with zucchini. Wash out pan.

  * Once water is boiling, add penne to pot. Cook until al dente, 9-11 minutes. Reserve 1 cup pasta cooking water, then drain well.

  * Meanwhile, heat 1 TBSP butter (2 TBSP for 4 servings) and a drizzle of olive oil in pan used for mushrooms over medium-high heat. Add tomatoes and season with salt, pepper, and Italian Seasoning. Cook, stirring, until tomatoes are softened, 2-4 minutes. Stir in half the chives and juice from half the lemon. Reduce heat to low, then stir in stock concentrate and ¼ cup reserved pasta cooking water (⅓ cup for 4). Whisk in crème fraîche; season with salt and pepper.

  * Add zucchini, mushrooms, chicken, and drained penne to pan with sauce; stir to combine. Stir in 1 TBSP butter (2 TBSP for 4 servings) until melted. (TIP: If necessary, add more reserved pasta cooking water a splash at a time until penne is coated in a creamy sauce.) Divide pasta between plates. Sprinkle with Parmesan and remaining chives. Serve with remaining lemon wedges on the side.
