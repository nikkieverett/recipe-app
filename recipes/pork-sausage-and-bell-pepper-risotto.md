href: https://www.hellofresh.com/recipes/pork-sausage-and-bell-pepper-risotto-617041791f771a6a0b36e4b2
ingredients: |-
  * 4 cups chicken broth
  * 2 unit Scallions
  * 1 unit Bell Pepper
  * 1 clove Garlic
  * 1 unit Lemon
  * 9 ounces Italian sausage
  * ¾ cup Arborio Rice
  * ¼ cup Parmesan Cheese
  * 1 tablespoon Italian Seasoning
  * 4﻿ teaspoon Olive Oil
  * 2 tablespoon Butter
  * Salt
  * Pepper
directions: >-
  1. Adjust rack to top position and preheat oven to 425 degrees. Wash and dry
  produce. • In a medium pot, combine stock concentrates and 4 cups water (7
  cups for 4 servings). Bring to a simmer, then reduce heat to low. • Trim and
  thinly slice scallions, separating whites from greens. Peel and mince or grate
  garlic. Halve, core, and slice bell pepper into ½-inch-thick strips. Quarter
  lemon.

  2. Remove sausage* from casing; discard casing. • Heat a large drizzle of olive oil in a large pan over medium-high heat. Add sausage and cook, breaking up meat into pieces, until browned and cooked through, 4-6 minutes. • Turn off heat. Using a slotted spoon, transfer sausage to a paper-towel-lined plate, leaving as much oil in pan as possible.

  3. Heat pan with reserved oil over medium heat; add scallion whites, garlic, rice, and ½ tsp Italian Seasoning (1 tsp for 4 servings). (You’ll use more Italian Seasoning later.) Cook, stirring, until scallion whites are softened and rice is translucent, 1-2 minutes. TIP: If pan seems dry, add another drizzle of olive oil. • Add ½ cup stock; stir, scraping up any browned bits from bottom of pan, until liquid has mostly absorbed.

  4. Repeat process with remaining stock—adding ½ cup at a time and stirring until liquid has mostly absorbed—until rice is al dente and mixture is creamy, 25-30 minutes. TIP: Depending on the size of your pan, you may need a little more or a little less liquid.

  5. While risotto simmers, toss bell pepper on a baking sheet with a large drizzle of olive oil and 1 tsp Italian Seasoning (1½ tsp for 4 servings). (Use the rest of the Italian Seasoning as you like.) Season with salt and pepper. • Roast on top rack until softened and lightly charred, 15-20 minutes.

  6. Once risotto is done, stir in sausage, roasted bell pepper, half the Parmesan, and 2 TBSP butter (3 TBSP for 4 servings). Add a squeeze of lemon juice to taste and season with salt and pepper. • Divide between bowls and sprinkle with scallion greens and remaining Parmesan. Serve with any remaining lemon wedges on the side.
