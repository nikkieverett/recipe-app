  1. • Adjust racks to middle and top positions and preheat oven to 425 degrees.
  Wash and dry produce. • Cut potatoes into ½-inch-thick wedges. Trim, peel, and
  cut carrots on a diagonal into ½-inch-thick pieces.

  2.  Place 1 TBSP butter (2 TBSP for 4 servings) in a small microwave-safe bowl; microwave until just melted, 30 seconds. • Stir in half the Fry Seasoning (you’ll use the rest later), a big pinch of salt, and pepper. Add panko and stir until evenly combined.

  3. Place 1 TBSP butter (2 TBSP for 4 servings) in a second small microwave-safe bowl; microwave until just melted, 30 seconds. Add maple syrup, mustard, and a pinch of salt; stir until smooth. • Reserve 1 TBSP of the mixture (2 TBSP for 4) for brushing onto chicken in step 5.

  4. Toss potatoes on a baking sheet with a large drizzle of olive oil, remaining Fry Seasoning, salt, and pepper. • On a separate baking sheet, toss carrots with a drizzle of olive oil, salt, and pepper. Push carrots to one side of sheet.

  5. Pat chicken* dry with paper towels; season all over with salt and pepper. • Place on opposite side of baking sheet from carrots. Evenly spread reserved maple mustard onto tops of chicken, then

  6. Transfer chicken and carrots to middle rack and potatoes to top rack. • Roast until chicken is golden brown and cooked through and veggies are tender, 15-18 minutes. TIP: If chicken is done before veggies, remove from sheet and continue roasting veggies until browned and tender, 5-7 minutes more. • Divide chicken, potato wedges, and carrots between plates. Serve with remaining maple mustard on the side for dipping or drizzling.
