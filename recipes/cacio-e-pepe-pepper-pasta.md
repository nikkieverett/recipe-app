servings: 2-3 servings
notes:
directions: |-
  * Cook the pasta in a large stockpot of generously-salted water
  * Boil your pasta according to package instructions until it just barely al dente (try to avoid overcooking the pasta)
  * While the pasta water comes to a boil finely-grate the cheese by hand
  * Once the pasta is about 1 minute away from being al dente carefully scoop out 2 cups of the starchy boiling pasta water and transfer the water into a separate heat-proof container
  * Set aside
  * Drain the pasta then transfer the pasta back to the hot stockpot placed off of the hot burner.
  * Add in the diced butter, tomatoes, and 1 cup of the starchy pasta water and toss quickly to combine
  * Add in the cheese and black pepper and quickly toss to combine
  * Continue to gradually add in extra starchy pasta water as needed until the cheese has completely melted and turned into a silky sauce that coats the pasta evenly
  * Dish up the hot pasta and serve immediately garnished with extra cheese and black pepper if desired
ingredients: |-
  * 8 ounces pasta (I recommend bucatini, thick spaghetti, linguine, or fettuccine)

  * 2 ounces (about 1 cup) freshly-grated* pecorino or parmesan cheese
