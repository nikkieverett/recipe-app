 finely-grate the cheese by hand.
reserve some of the starchy pasta water.  once the pasta is about 1 minute away from being al dente
 carefully scoop out 2 cups of the starchy boiling pasta water and transfer the water into a separate heat-proof container.  set aside.
drain the pasta.  drain the pasta using a colander.  then transfer the pasta back to the hot stockpot
 placed off of the hot burner.
add in the diced butter
 tomatoes and 1 cup of the starchy pasta water and toss quickly to combine.  add in the cheese and black pepper and quickly toss to combine. continue to gradually add in extra starchy pasta water
 as needed
 until the cheese has completely melted and turned into a silky sauce that coats the pasta evenly.
serve.  dish up the hot pasta and serve immediately
 garnished with extra cheese and black pepper if desired.
