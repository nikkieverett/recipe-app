directions: |-
  * Cook the potatoes in boiling water until they are just tender, and easily pierced with the tip of a sharp knife
  * Drain and cut into bite sized pieces, in quarters or in half, depending on the size of your potatoes
  * While the potatoes are cooking make the dressing
  * Put all the ingredients in a small jar or measuring cup and blend with a stick blender until bright yellow and creamy (emulsified)
  * Be sure to taste it now to see if you need more salt, more lemon, or whatever
  * While the potatoes are hot, dress them in several tablespoons of the dressing, gently tossing to make sure they all get coated
  * Let cool, then cover and refrigerate until cold.
  * When the potatoes are chilled, add the green onions and fresh oregano
  * Season with salt and fresh cracked black pepper to taste
  * Toss with more dressing and serve
