directions: 'cook the potatoes in boiling water until they are just tender
 and easily pierced with the tip of a sharp knife. drain and cut into bite sized pieces
 in quarters or in half
 depending on the size of your potatoes.
while the potatoes are cooking make the dressing. put all the ingredients in a small jar or measuring cup and blend with a stick blender until bright yellow and creamy (emulsified.) be sure to taste it now to see if you need more salt
 more lemon
 or whatever.
while the potatoes are hot
 dress them in several tablespoons of the dressing
 gently tossing to make sure they all get coated. let cool
 then cover and refrigerate until cold.
when the potatoes are chilled
 add the green onions and fresh oregano. season with salt and fresh cracked black pepper to taste. toss with more dressing and serve.'
