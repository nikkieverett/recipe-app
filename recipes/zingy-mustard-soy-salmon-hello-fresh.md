  * 5 teaspoon White Wine Vinegar
  * 10 ounce Salmon
  * 1 teaspoon Sriracha
  * 2 unit Scallions
  * 1 unit Lime

  * 1 tablespoon Vegetable Oil
  * 3 tablespoon Butter

  * Pepper
directions: >-
  **Prep**


  • Adjust rack to top position and preheat oven to 425 degrees. Wash and dry all produce.


  • Trim, peel, and halve carrots lengthwise; cut into 3-inch-long, ½-inch-thick pieces. Peel and mince or grate ginger. Trim and thinly slice scallions, separating whites from greens. Zest and quarter lime.


  **Roast Carrots**


  • Toss carrots on a baking sheet with a large drizzle of oil, salt, and pepper. 


  • Roast on top rack until browned and tender, 20-25 minutes. Cover to keep warm.


  **Cook Rice**


  • Meanwhile, melt 1 TBSP butter in a small pot over medium-high heat. Add half the ginger; cook, stirring, until fragrant, 30 seconds. 


  • Stir in rice, ¾ cup water (1½ cups for 4 servings), and a pinch of salt. Bring to a boil, then cover and reduce to a low simmer. Cook until rice is tender, 15-18 minutes. 


  • Keep covered off heat until ready to serve.


  **Make Pickles and Sauce**


  • While rice cooks, in a small bowl, combine scallion whites, vinegar, and a pinch of salt. Set aside to pickle. 


  • In a separate small bowl, combine teriyaki sauce, remaining ginger, a squeeze of lime juice, and sriracha to taste.


  **Cook Fish**


  • Pat salmon* dry with paper towels. Season all over with salt and pepper. 


  • Heat a drizzle of oil in a large, preferably nonstick, pan over medium high heat. Add salmon skin sides down; cook until skin is lightly browned and crispy, 5-7 minutes. Carefully flip and cook until fish is opaque and cooked through, 1-2 minutes more. 


  • Transfer salmon to a plate. Return pan to medium-high heat and add sauce. Bring to a boil and cook until reduced by half, 2-4 minutes. 


  • Remove from heat and stir in 1 TBSP butter (2 TBSP for 4 servings).


  **Serve**


  • Fluff rice with a fork; stir in 1 TBSP butter (2 TBSP for 4 servings) and season with salt and pepper. 


  • Toss carrots with lime zest to taste. 


  • Divide rice, carrots, and salmon between plates; drizzle salmon with sauce. Top with pickled scallion whites (draining first). Garnish with scallion greens. Top with as many sesame seeds as you like and any remaining sriracha to taste. Serve with remaining lime wedges on the side.
