  Feel free to adjust the sugar and honey depending on how sweet your melon is.
  If you find it too thick, just add more water and blend again.


  These juice blends work perfectly as a cocktail base.  Play with them: tequila, vodka or gin would be amazing with any of these.  Or pour about 2 tbsp at the bottom of a champagne glass and top with a sparkling wine for a fresh brunch drink.


  You can easily cut this recipe in half, depending on the amount of melon you have on hand, or if you are trying to put leftover melon to good use.
