directions: >-
  

  1. Heat the oven to 400ºF. Meanwhile, stir 1 1/2 cups panko breadcrumbs, 1/4 cup grated Parmesan cheese, 1/4 teaspoon of the kosher salt, 1/4 teaspoon of the black pepper, 1 teaspoon smoked paprika, 1/4 teaspoon cayenne pepper, and 1/4 teaspoon onion powder together in a pie plate or small rimmed baking sheet. Whisk 2 large eggs and 1 tablespoon hot sauce together in a medium shallow bowl or pie plate.

  2. Cut 2 boneless, skinless chicken breasts in half horizontally so you end up with 4 thin pieces of chicken. Working with 1 piece of chicken at a time, place in a large zip-top bag and pound with a rolling pin or the flat side of a meat mallet until 1/4-inch thick.

  3. Season the chicken with the remaining 3/4 teaspoon kosher salt. Bread the chicken 1 piece at a time: Dip into the egg mixture until coated and let the excess drip off. Gently press into the panko mixture until completely coated. Place on a rimmed baking sheet.

  4. Bake about 30 minutes total.

  5. A few minutes before the chicken is ready, heat 1/2 cup honey, 2 tablespoons unsalted butter, 3 minced garlic cloves, 1 teaspoon cayenne pepper, 1/2 teaspoon onion powder, and 1 pinch kosher salt in a small skillet over medium heat, stirring occasionally, until simmering. Continue simmering until the sauce is bubbling and fragrant, about 2 minutes. Turn off the heat.

  6. Working with 1 piece of chicken at a time, dip in the sauce until completely coated, then place on a serving plate (scrape out any remaining sauce and wash or soak the pan before the sauce solidifies). Garnish with coarsely chopped fresh thyme leaves and flaky salt if desired.
