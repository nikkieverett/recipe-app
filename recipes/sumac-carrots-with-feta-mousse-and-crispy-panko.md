  * 1/2; cup panko breadcrumbs
  * 3 medium carrots (6 to 8 oz. total), peeled
  * 2 tablespoons vegetable oil 
  * 2 teaspoons honey
  * 1/2 to 1 teaspoon ground sumac
  * 1/2 teaspoon kosher salt, divided
  * 1/2; teaspoon black pepper, divided
  * 6 ounces feta cheese, crumbled (about 1 ½ cups), at room temperature

  * 2 tablespoons fresh lemon juice (from 1 lemon) 
  * Torn fresh mint leaves
directions: >-
  Step 1


  Toast panko in a 12-inch skillet over medium-high, stirring constantly, until golden, 4 to 5 minutes. Set aside.


  Step 2


  Cut carrots into thirds, and then cut each third in half lengthwise (or into fourths, depending on width of carrots).


  Step 3


  Heat oil in a cast-iron skillet over medium until hot. Cook carrots, flat side down, in hot oil, without turning, until tender, 10 to 12 minutes. (The cut sides will be very dark.)


  Step 4


  Remove skillet from heat; stir in ¼ cup water, honey, and sumac. Return to heat. Cook, stirring constantly, until most of the water has cooked off and carrots are coated, 4 to 5 minutes. Season with ½ teaspoon of the salt and ¼ teaspoon of the pepper, and transfer to an airtight container. Chill carrots about 30 minutes.


  Step 5


  Meanwhile, pulse feta and cream cheese in a food processor until blended, about 5 pulses. Add whipping cream, lemon juice, and remaining ½ teaspoon salt and ¼ teaspoon pepper. Process mixture until smooth, 2 to 3 minutes. Set aside until ready to use.


  Step 6


  Spread Feta Mousse onto bottom of serving plate, and top with carrots. Sprinkle carrots with toasted panko and mint before serving.
