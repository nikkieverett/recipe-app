href: https://www.hellofresh.com/recipes/chicken-katsu-60d333de2d8a3c2d6548d6a6
ingredients: |-
  * 1 thumb Ginger
  * ½ cup Jasmine Rice
  * 6 ounce Green Beans
  * 10 ounce Chicken Cutlets
  * 1 teaspoon Garlic Powder
  * ½ cup Panko Breadcrumbs
  * 1 tablespoon Cornstarch
  * 2 tablespoon Sour Cream
  * 4 tablespoon Katsu Sauce
  * 1 tablespoon Sesame Seeds
  * 2 teaspoon Vegetable Oil
  * 1 tablespoon Butter
  * Salt
  * Pepper
directions: >-
  1. Adjust rack to top position and preheat oven to 425 degrees. Wash and dry
  produce. • Peel and mince or grate ginger. • Heat a drizzle of oil in a small
  pot over medium-high heat. Add ginger; cook, stirring, until fragrant, 1-2
  minutes. • Stir in rice and ¾ cup water (1½ cups for 4 servings). Bring to a
  boil; cover and reduce heat to low. Cook until rice is tender, 15-18 minutes.
  Keep covered off heat until ready to serve.

  2. While rice cooks, toss green beans on a baking sheet with a drizzle of oil; season with salt and pepper. • Roast on top rack until browned and tender, 12-15 minutes.

  3. Meanwhile, pat chicken* dry with paper towels. Place between two pieces of plastic wrap and pound with a mallet or heavy-bottomed pan until ½ inch thick. Season all over with garlic powder, salt, and pepper.

  4. On a shallow dish or plate, combine panko, cornstarch, and ½ tsp salt (1 tsp for 4 servings). Brush a thin layer of sour cream onto both sides of chicken (you may not use all the sour cream). Working one piece at a time, press chicken into panko mixture, coating all over.

  5. Heat a 1⁄3-inch layer of oil in a large, preferably nonstick, pan over medium-high heat. Once oil is hot enough that a pinch of panko sizzles when added to the pan, add chicken. Cook until panko is golden brown and chicken is cooked through, 2-3 minutes per side. (For 4 servings, cook in batches.) TIP: Thinner pieces will cook faster. • Transfer to a paper-towel-lined plate.

  6. Place katsu sauce in a small microwave-safe bowl; microwave until warm, 20 seconds. • Fluff rice with a fork; stir in 1 TBSP butter (2 TBSP for 4 servings) and season with salt and pepper. • Divide rice, chicken, and green beans between plates. Drizzle chicken with katsu sauce to taste (or serve on the side for dipping). Sprinkle chicken and green beans with as many sesame seeds as you like and serve.
