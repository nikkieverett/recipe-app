ingredients: |-
  * 2 unit Poblano Pepper
  * 1 unit Yellow Onion
  * 13.4 ounce Black Beans
  * 10 ounce Ground Pork
  * 1.5 ounce Tomato Paste
  * ½ cup White Cheddar Cheese
  * 1 unit Roma Tomato
  * 1 unit Lime
  * 2 tablespoon Smoky Red Pepper Crema
  * 1 tablespoon Southwest Spice Blend
  * 1 unit Chicken Stock Concentrate
  * 1 teaspoon Hot Sauce
directions: >-
  1. Adjust rack to top position and preheat oven to 425 degrees. Wash and dry
  produce. • Halve poblanos lengthwise; remove stems and seeds. Dice tomato.
  Halve, peel, and finely chop onion. Zest and quarter lime. Drain and rinse
  beans.

  2. Place poblano halves on a baking sheet and rub all over with a drizzle of oil. Season with salt and pepper. • Roast on top rack until browned and softened, 15-18 minutes.

  3. Meanwhile, in a small bowl, combine tomato, 2 TBSP onion (4 TBSP for 4 servings), half the lime zest, and a squeeze of lime juice to taste. Season with salt and pepper. • In a separate small bowl, combine smoky red pepper crema, remaining lime zest, and a squeeze of lime juice to taste. Season with salt and pepper. Add water 1 tsp at a time until mixture reaches a drizzling consistency.

  4. Heat a drizzle of oil in a large pan over medium-high heat. Add remaining onion and season with salt and pepper. Cook, stirring, until softened, 4-5 minutes. • Add pork* and Southwest Spice; season with salt and pepper. Cook, breaking up meat into pieces, until browned and cooked through, 4-6 minutes.

  5. Add tomato paste, stock concentrate, half the beans (use the rest as you like), and ¼ cup water to pan with pork filling. (For 4 servings, use all the beans and 1⁄3 cup water.) Stir until mixture is saucy and thoroughly combined, 1-2 minutes. Season generously with salt and pepper. • Once poblano halves are done roasting, remove sheet from oven. Stuff with up to half the filling (save the rest for serving). Evenly sprinkle with cheddar. • Return to oven until cheese melts, 3-4 minutes.

  6. Divide remaining filling between plates; top with stuffed poblanos, salsa, and crema. Drizzle with hot sauce if desired. Serve with any remaining lime wedges on the side.
