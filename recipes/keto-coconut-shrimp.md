href: https://www.flavcity.com/keto-coconut-shrimp/
ingredients: |-
  * 1 pound shrimp peeled & cleaned
  * ¾ cup coconut flour
  * 1 teaspoon each onion & garlic powder
  * 2 egg slightly beaten
  * ½ cup each pork rind crumbs & unsweetened shredded coconut flakes
  * Kosher salt & fresh pepper
  * Avocado or grapeseed oil
directions: >-
  1. For the keto coconut shrimp, prepare the dredge station by adding the
  coconut flour, onion & garlic powder, ½ teaspoon salt, and a few cracks of
  pepper to a shallow dish, mix well. Add the eggs to a small dish/bowl and
  lightly whisk. Add the pork rinds to a zip-top bag and use a rolling pin to
  bash them into breadcrumbs the size of panko. Add them to a dish along with
  the coconut flakes, ¼ teaspoon salt, few cracks of pepper, and mix well.

  2. Season the shrimp with a little pinch of salt on both sides then dredge in the coconut flour shake off any excess, dredge in the eggs, shake off any excess, dredge in the pork rind, and coconut flakes, and make sure the shrimp is well covered. Move shrimp to a wire rack set over a sheet tray. Repeat the process with the remaining shrimp.

  3. For the regular version of the coconut shrimp, follow the same exact steps but you all-purpose flour instead of coconut, and panko breadcrumbs instead of pork rinds.

  4. Pour 2 inches of oil into a frying pan and bring the temperature to 340-350 F. While the oil is coming to temperature, it’s ok that the shrimp sit at room temperature so the coating can firm up. Fry the shrimp in batches, for 2-3 minutes on each side, or until golden brown. Remove shrimp and place on a clean wire rack and fry the next batch.

  5. Make the sriracha dipping sauce by combining all the ingredients in a small bowl and whisking well. Check for seasoning, you may need more sriracha if you like it spicy.

  6. If using an air fryer to make the coconut shrimp, spray the basket with non-stick and fry for 8 minutes at 390 F, flipping the shrimp halfway.
