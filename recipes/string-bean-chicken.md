  * 1/4 tsp white pepper
  * 1/2 tsp salt
  * 1 tbsp shaoxing wine
  * 1/2 tbsp avocado oil
  * 1/2 tbsp cornstarch



  * 1/4 cup chicken stock
  * 2 tbsp soy sauce
  * 1 tbsp oyster sauce
  * 1/2 tbsp dark soy sauce
  * 1 tbsp sugar
  * 1 tsp sesame oil
  * 1/4 tsp msg
  * 1 tbsp ginger, chopped
  * 4 cloves garlic, chopped
  * 1 medium onion, cut into quarters and petals separated
  * 12 oz string beans, cut into 2" pieces (about 2 cups)
  * 1 cup avocado oil
  * Cornstarch slurry (1/2 tbsp cornstarch + 2 tbsp water)
  * Salt to taste
directions: >-
  1. Slice chicken breast into 1/4" discs across the grain. Place in a mixing
  bowl and marinate with salt, white pepper, soy sauce, shaoxing wine, and
  cornstarch for 15-30 minutes in the fridge.\

  \

  2. Cut green beans into 2" pieces and onion into quarters and separate the petals. Chop garlic and ginger and set aside in separate bowls.\

  \

  3. Premix your sauce by mixing together chicken stock, soy sauce, oyster sauce, dark soy sauce, sugar, sesame oil, and msg.\

  \

  4. Heat 1 cup of avocado oil on high to 350F. Cook chicken in oil for 2 minutes (this technique is called velveting and will keep the lean chicken nice and juicy). Remove chicken and oil, leaving about 2 tbsp left in the pan.\

  \

  5. Stir Fry green beans for 30 seconds then add your onions for another minute. Add in your ginger and garlic and stir fry for 30 seconds and season with salt. Add back your chicken and sauce and mix until combined, then add your cornstarch slurry and mix until thickened. Serve with freshly steamed rice and enjoy!
