ingredients: |-
  * 2 unit Scallions
  * 1 unit Lime
  * 1 unit  Long Green Pepper
  * 1 unit Yellow Onion
  * 1 clove Garlic
  * 4 ounce Red Cabbage & Carrot Mix
  * 2 tablespoon Mayonnaise
  * 3 tablespoon Sour Cream

  * 1 tablespoon Fajita Spice Blend
  * 10 ounce Ground Turkey
  * 1 unit Tex-Mex Paste
  * ¼ cup Panko Breadcrumbs
  * ½ teaspoon Sugar
directions: >-
  1. Wash and dry produce. • Trim and thinly slice scallions, separating whites
  from greens; mince whites. Zest and quarter lime. Peel and mince or grate
  garlic. Halve, deseed, and slice green pepper into 1⁄2-inch strips. Halve,
  peel, and slice onion into 1⁄2-inch-thick wedges.

  2.  In a medium bowl (large bowl for 4 servings), combine red cabbage and carrot mix, mayonnaise, half the sour cream, half the scallion greens, half the lime zest, juice from half the lime (whole lime for 4), and 1⁄2 tsp sugar (1 tsp for 4). Season with salt and pepper. Set aside. • In a small bowl, combine guacamole with remaining sour cream. Season with salt and pepper. Set aside.

  3. In a large bowl, combine turkey*, garlic, scallion whites, panko, Tex Mex paste, half the Fajita Spice Blend, remaining lime zest, and 1 TBSP water (2 TBSP for 4 servings). Mix gently until thoroughly combined. • Form turkey mixture into 6 1 1⁄2-inch meatballs (12 meatballs for 4). (TIP: Coat hands with oil first to prevent sticking.) Set aside on a plate.

  4. Heat a large drizzle of oil in a large pan over medium-high heat. Add green pepper, onion, remaining Fajita Spice Blend, salt, and pepper. Cook, stirring occasionally, until tender and browned, 5-7 minutes. • Turn off heat; transfer to a plate. Wash out pan.

  5. Heat a drizzle of oil in same pan over medium-high heat. Add meatballs; gently press down with a spatula to make 1⁄2-inch-thick patties. (For 4 servings, cook in batches if necessary.) Cook until browned and cooked through, 2-3 minutes per side.

  6. Divide fajita veggies and slaw between plates. Top veggies with turkey patties. Top patties with creamy guacamole and remaining scallion greens. Serve with remaining lime wedges on the side.
