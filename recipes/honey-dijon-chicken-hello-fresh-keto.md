href: https://www.hellofresh.com/recipes/sweet-as-honey-dijon-chicken-618be4f6e8b61739d04ab72f
ingredients: |-
  * 6 ounce Green Beans
  * 1 clove Garlic
  * 1 unit Lemon
  * 6 ounce Cauliflower Rice
  * 10 ounce Chicken Cutlets
  * 2 unit Chicken Stock Concentrate
  * 1.5 ounce Honey Dijon Dressing
  * 2 tablespoon Sour Cream
  * ¼ cup Monterey Jack Cheese
  * 1 tablespoon Cooking Oil
  * 2 tablespoon Butter
  * Salt
  * Pepper
directions: >-
  1. Adjust rack to top position and preheat oven to 425 degrees. Wash and dry
  produce (except cauliflower rice). • Trim green beans if necessary. Peel and
  mince or grate garlic. Zest and quarter lemon.

  2. Place cauliflower “rice” in a medium microwave-safe bowl with ½ tsp salt (1 tsp for 4 servings). Cover bowl with plastic wrap and poke a few holes in wrap. Microwave until tender, about 5 minutes. Carefully uncover (watch out for steam!) and set aside. • Meanwhile, toss green beans on a baking sheet with a drizzle of oil, salt, and pepper. Roast on top rack until tender, 12-15 minutes.

  3. Pat chicken* dry with paper towels. Season all over with salt and pepper. • Heat a drizzle of oil in a large pan over medium-high heat. Add chicken; cook until browned and cooked through, 3-5 minutes per side. • Transfer to a cutting board; tent with foil to keep warm.

  4. Return pan used for chicken over medium-high heat. Add ¼ cup water and half the stock concentrates (1⁄3 cup water for 4 servings). Cook, scraping up any browned bits from bottom of pan, until thickened slightly, 2-3 minutes. • Remove from heat. Stir in honey Dijon dressing and 1 TBSP butter (2 TBSP for 4). Season with salt and pepper to taste.

  5. While sauce cooks, heat a drizzle of oil in a medium pan over medium-high heat. Add cauliflower “rice” and garlic; cook until garlic is fragrant, 30 seconds. • Add ¼ cup water and remaining stock concentrates. Cook, stirring occasionally, until water has mostly absorbed and cauliflower is tender, 2-3 minutes. • Stir in sour cream, Monterey Jack, and 1 TBSP butter (2 TBSP for 4 servings) until melted. Remove from heat. (If “rice” is too thick, add a splash of water.)

  6. Slice chicken crosswise. • Toss green beans with a squeeze of lemon juice and lemon zest to taste. • Divide chicken, green beans and cauliflower “rice” between plates. Drizzle sauce over chicken and serve with remaining lemon wedges on the side.
