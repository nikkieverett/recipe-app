directions: 'mix the yogurt and honey together until well combined. add the cranberries and raisins and stir again.
line a baking tray with foil and pour the yogurt mixture on top. spread it depending on how thick or thin you want your bark to be. mine was approx 1/2 inch thick.
sprinkle the strawberries
 chocolate chips and desiccated coconut on top and place in the freezer for 2-4 hours or until it is completely frozen.
remove from the freezer and use a sharp knife to break the bark into pieces. the bark can be stored in the freezer in food bags.'
