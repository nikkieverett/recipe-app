  1. F﻿ry bacon.  Roughly chop. Set aside.

  2. F﻿ill large pot with water. Heat to boiling.  Cook pasta according to directions.

  3. Slice the chicken breasts in half widthwise. This is known as butterflying.

  4. Place the sliced chicken breast one at a time into a plastic zip bag and gently pound it with a mallet or the bottom of a medium-sized pot.

  5. Season the chicken breasts on both sides with salt and pepper and briefly set them to the side on a sheet tray lined with parchment paper.

  6. Next, in a shallow wide bowl or a cake or pie pan, add in the flour and season it lightly with salt and pepper, and mix until combined using a whisk or fork.

  7. One at a time, gently dredge the pounded seasoned chicken breasts in some seasoned all-purpose flour. Set them to the side on a sheet tray lined with parchment paper until they are all finished.

  8. In same frying pan used to cook bacon, reheat bacon grease over medium heat.

  9. After about 90 seconds of the oil heating up, add the chicken and cook for 3 to 4 minutes or until browned and cooked through.

  10. Set the cooked chicken breasts to the side, add the sliced mushrooms to the pan, turn the heat up to high, and sauté until well browned, which takes about 4 to 6 minutes.

  11. Scrape the mushrooms to one side of the pan, and on the other side of the pan, add in the shallots, garlic, and 1 tablespoon of butter and quickly stir and sauté for 1 minute. Then mix everything together.

  12. Deglaze with white wine and cook over high heat until au sec or almost gone.

  13. Remove the pan from the heat, add in the juice of ½ lemon, and vigorously mix in the remaining 12 tablespoons of ice-cold butter until emulsified.

  14. Next, stir in the cheese until combined and creamy. See chef note below if the sauce breaks.

  15. Season the sauce with salt and pepper, and then place the chicken back in to heat it back up.

  16. Garnish with parsley, more cheese, and the zest of the remaining ½ lemon.  Serve over pasta.
