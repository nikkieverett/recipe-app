  #### FOR THE CILANTRO-PORK MEATBALLS:


  1. Have a rimmed baking sheet ready. Place 1 pound ground pork, 3/4 teaspoon ground white pepper, 1 tablespoon soy sauce, and 1 tablespoon fish sauce in a medium bowl.

  2. Prepare the following, adding each to the bowl with the ground pork as you prepare it: Mince 5 garlic cloves. Pick the leaves and tender stems from 1/2 bunch fresh cilantro and finely chop until you have 1/2 cup; add 1/4 cup to the bowl, then reserve the remaining 1/4 cup for garnish.

  3. Mix the pork mixture with your hands until thoroughly combined. Roll the mixture into 25 to 29 (1-inch) meatballs (about 1 tablespoon each) and place on the baking sheet.


  #### FOR THE NOODLE SOUP:


  1. Bring a large pot of water to a boil over medium-high heat. Meanwhile, thinly slice 3 medium scallions (about 1/2 cup) and place in a medium pot. Add 5 1/2 cups low-sodium chicken broth, 3 tablespoons soy sauce, and 2 tablespoons fish sauce. Bring to a boil over medium-high heat. Gently drop meatballs into the soup, reduce the heat to maintain a simmer, and cook until the meatballs float and are cooked through, 3 to 5 minutes. Taste and season with more fish sauce and/or soy sauce as needed.

  2. Add 8 ounces dried wheat noodles to the boiling water and cook according to package directions until tender. Turn off the heat. Drain noodles, then transfer them directly to serving bowls.

  3. Ladle the soup, along with a few meatballs, into each bowl. Garnish with the reserved cilantro.
