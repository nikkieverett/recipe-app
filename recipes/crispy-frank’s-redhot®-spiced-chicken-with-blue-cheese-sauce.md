ingredients: |-
  * 12 ounce Yukon Gold Potatoes
  * 2 unit Scallions
  * 6 tablespoon Sour Cream
  * ¼ cup Panko Breadcrumbs
  * 1.5 ounce Blue Cheese Dressing
  * 12 ounce Carrots
  * 1 tablespoon Fry Seasoning
  * 10 ounce Chicken Cutlets
  * 1 teaspoon Hot Sauce
  * 0.24 ounce Frank's RedHot® Original Seasoning Blend
  * 2 tablespoon Butter
directions: >-
  1. Adjust racks to top and middle positions and preheat oven to 425 degrees.
  Wash and dry produce. • Trim, peel, and cut carrots on a diagonal into
  ½-inch-thick pieces. Dice potatoes into ½-inch pieces. Trim and thinly slice
  scallions, separating whites from greens.

  2. Toss carrots on a baking sheet with a large drizzle of olive oil, half the Fry Seasoning (all for 4 servings), salt, and pepper. • Roast on top rack until golden brown and tender, 20-25 minutes.

  3. While carrots roast, place potatoes in a medium pot with enough salted water to cover by 2 inches. Bring to a boil and cook until tender, 15-20 minutes. • Reserve ½ cup potato cooking liquid; drain and return potatoes to pot. Mash with one packet sour cream (two packets for 4 servings) and 1 TBSP butter (2 TBSP for 4) until smooth, adding splashes of reserved potato cooking liquid as needed. (You’ll use more sour cream in the next step.) • Stir in half the scallion greens. Season with salt and pepper. Keep covered off heat until ready to serve.

  4. Meanwhile, pat chicken* dry with paper towels; season with salt and pepper. • Place 1 TBSP butter (2 TBSP for 4 servings) in a shallow microwave-safe dish. Microwave until melted, 30 seconds. Stir in panko, Frank’s RedHot® Original Seasoning Blend, and a pinch of salt and pepper. • Brush one packet sour cream (two packets for 4) onto tops of chicken in a thin layer. (You’ll use the remaining sour cream in the next step.) Working one piece at a time, dip brushed sides of chicken into panko mixture, pressing to adhere (no need to coat the undersides). • Place chicken, coated sides up, on a second, lightly oiled baking sheet.

  5. Roast chicken on middle rack until browned and cooked through, 15-18 minutes. Transfer to a plate to rest. • While chicken cooks, in a small bowl, combine blue cheese dressing, scallion whites, and remaining sour cream.

  6. Divide carrots, mashed potatoes, and chicken between plates. Top chicken with blue cheese sauce, remaining scallion greens, and hot sauce if desired. Serve with any remaining blue cheese sauce on the side.
