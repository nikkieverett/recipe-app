directions: 'slice the eggs in half lengthwise
 remove the yolks
 and place them in the bowl of a mini food processor. arrange the whites on a serving platter
 gently wiping them clean if necessary. to the yolks
 add the mayonnaise
 1 tablespoon of the sriracha
 the mustard
 the worcestershire sauce
 the salt
 the black pepper
 and the sugar. process until smooth. (if you dont have a mini food processor
 pass the yolks through a sieve before combining them with the other ingredients. this will make them easier to blend without getting lumps.) taste and adjust the seasoning
 adding more sriracha if necessary.
fill a piping bag fitted with an open-star or large plain tip with the yolk mixture. (alternatively
 fill a sealable plastic bag with the yolk mixture
 and use your hand to push the mixture to one corner of the bag. use scissors to snip off the tip of the corner
 opening up a 1/4–in [6-mm] hole.) pipe the yolk mixture evenly into the egg white halves. (or
 for a less fussy preparation
 simply spoon the yolk mixture into the egg whites.) sprinkle with paprika and chives
 and serve.'
make-ahead: 'the eggs can be cooked and stored whole in the refrigerator several days ahead of time. the empty egg halves and filling mixture can be refrigerated separately
 wrapped tightly in plastic wrap
 for up to 2 days. bring the filling to room temperature and taste and adjust seasoning if necessary before filling. the eggs should be filled as close to serving time as possible.'
