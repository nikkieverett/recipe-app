 cheese
 yolks
 basil
 and parsley to blend.

meanwhile
 bring a large pot of salted water to a boil over high heat
add the spaghetti and cook (about 10 minutes) until it is just tender but still firm to the bite
 stirring occasionally
drain

add the chicken to the pan with the pancetta and stir to combine
add the spaghetti and the cream mixture and toss over medium-low heat until the chicken is heated through and the sauce coats the spaghetti thickly (about 4 minutes
 do not boil or you might end up scrambling the eggs)

 with pepper and salt if needed (the pancetta will likely add all the salt you need)

 and serve'
