directions: |-
  * Heat the oil in a heavy large frying pan over medium heat
  * Add the pancetta and garlic and saute until it is brown and crisp (about 8 minutes)
  * Cool slightly
  * In a large bowl, whisk together the cream, cheese, yolks, basil, and parsley to blend
  * Meanwhile, bring a large pot of salted water to a boil over high heat
  * Add the spaghetti and cook (about 10 minutes) until it is just tender but still firm to the bite, stirring occasionally
  * Drain
  * Add the chicken to the pan with the pancetta and stir to combine
  * Add the spaghetti and the cream mixture and toss over medium-low heat until the chicken is heated through and the sauce coats the spaghetti thickly (about 4 minutes do not boil or you might end up scrambling the eggs)
  * Season the pasta to taste with pepper and salt if needed (the pancetta will likely add all the salt you need)
  * Transfer the pasta to a large wide serving bowl
  * Sprinkle the walnuts and lemon zest over and serve
