servings: "10"
rating: 3
ease: intermediate
notes: be careful when filling the pound cake and when transferring to the
  refrigerator. cutting the border too thin may cause the sides to spread too
  far once the cheesecake mixture is added. you can simply place the pound cake
  on a plate or tray before filling to make the transfer to the refrigerator
  easier. use something to prop up the sides in case they’ve bowed out too much;
  to prevent breaking. once the filling has set in the fridge; it will hold its
  shape.
