  1. Heat Olive Oil: In a large pot over medium heat, warm the olive oil. Add

  Cook, stirring often, until the onions soften (about 5 minutes).

  3. Combine Ingredients: Add the fire-roasted tomatoes, cannellini beans, stock, and parmesan rind. Bring to a boil, then reduce to a simmer. Cover and cook for 20 minutes, uncovering for the last 10 minutes. 

  4. Finish the Soup: Remove the lid and stir in the heavy cream. Add the grated parmesan cheese and spinach. Cook for an additional 5 to 10 minutes, stirring often, until the cheese melts and the spinach wilts. Adjust seasoning with additional salt and pepper if needed.

  5. Serve: Ladle the soup into bowls and top with extra parmesan cheese and crushed red pepper.
