directions: |-
  * Heat the oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat
  * Season the salmon filets (or fish if using) on both sides with salt and pepper and sear in the hot pan, flesh-side down first, for 5 minutes on each side, or until cooked to your liking
  * Once cooked, remove from the pan and set aside
  * Melt the butter in the remaining juices leftover in the pan
  * Add in the garlic and fry until fragrant (about one minute)
  * Fry the onion in the butter
  * Pour in the white wine (if using), and allow to reduce down slightly
  * Add the sun dried tomatoes and fry for 1-2 minutes to release their flavours
  * Reduce heat to low heat, add the half and half (or heavy cream), and bring to a gentle simmer, while stirring occasionally
  * Season with salt and pepper to your taste
  * Add in the spinach leaves and allow to wilt in the sauce, and add in the parmesan cheese
  * Allow sauce to simmer for a further minute until cheese melts through the sauce (for a thicker sauce, add the milk/cornstarch mixture to the centre of the pan, and continue to simmer while quickly stirring the mixture through until the sauce thickens)
