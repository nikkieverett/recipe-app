  * Pulse until the mixture reaches a fine crumble consistency

  * You want the butter to be well combined but to stop before the mixture turns into a ball (alternately you can combine the crust ingredients together in a mixing bowl with a pastry cutter or a fork)

  * Sprinkle the crust mixture evenly into the prepared pan

  * Then press the mixture down firmly to form an even layer

  * Bake the crust for 20 minutes or until it is lightly golden on top

  * Meanwhile whisk the lemon filling ingredients together in a medium mixing bowl until combined.

  * If your powdered sugar or flour are too chunky or there are lots of bubbles whisked into the filling feel free to just pour the filling through a fine-mesh strainer to get it nice and smooth before adding it to the crust (but if there are a few little clumps thatâ€™s ok too!)

  * Once the crust is done baking remove the pan from the oven and immediately pour the lemon filling on top of the hot crust

  * Return the pan to the oven and bake for 18-20 more minutes, or until the lemon filling has set

  * Remove the pan from the oven and transfer to a wire baking rack to cool until the bars reach room temperature

  * Then transfer to the refrigerator and let the bars chill for at least 2 hours

  * Sprinkle the tops of the bars with extra powdered sugar if you would like, then slice and serve
