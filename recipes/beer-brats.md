href: https://cravingtasty.com/pan-fried-bratwurst/
ingredients: |-
  * 4 bratwurst sausages
  * 2 Tbsp unsalted butter (or use olive oil, vegetable or corn oil)
  * 1 sweet onion (cut in halves or quarters and sliced)
  * 1 cup Belgian ale
directions: >-
  1. Preheat a cast iron pan over a medium-high heat. Add the butter and let it
  melt and start to turn light brown. The temperature should be about 325-350F
  at this point.

  2. Sear bratwurst for about 3 minutes per side, until it achieves deep golden brown color. 

  3. Add the onions and the beer, turn the heat to high and bring to a boil.

  4. Once the liquid is boiling, reduce heat and continue cooking, flipping the sausages and stirring the onions, until the internal temperature of the sausages reaches 160F. Cook uncovered to let the liquid reduce and intensify its flavor.

  5. Remove bratwurst from heat and serve hot, on a bun, or with you favorite side dish.
