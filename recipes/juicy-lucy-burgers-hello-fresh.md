ingredients: |-
  \
  24 ounce Yukon Gold Potatoes

  2 tablespoon Fry Seasoning

  1 clove Garlic

  1 unit Yellow Onion

  2 unit Roma Tomato

  5 teaspoon Balsamic Vinegar

  20 ounce Ground Beef

  1 cup Cheddar Cheese

  4 unit Potato Buns

  2 tablespoon Mayonnaise

  4 tablespoon Sour Cream

  4 tablespoon Ketchup

  1 tablespoon Vegetable Oil

  2 teaspoon Sugar

  Salt

  Pepper
directions: >-
  Adjust rack to top position and preheat oven to 425 degrees. Wash and dry all
  produce. Cut potatoes into ½-inch-thick wedges. Toss on a baking sheet with a
  drizzle of oil, half the Fry Seasoning (you’ll use the rest later), salt, and
  pepper. Peel garlic and wrap clove in a small piece of foil; place on same
  sheet. Roast on top rack, flipping potatoes halfway through, until tender and
  garlic is softened, 20-25 minutes. TIP: If garlic is done before potatoes,
  remove from sheet and continue roasting potatoes.




  Meanwhile, halve, peel, and thinly slice onion. Dice tomato. Heat a drizzle of oil in a large pan over medium heat. Add onion; cook, stirring, until softened, 4-5 minutes. Season with salt and pepper. Stir in tomato, half the vinegar (use all for 4 servings), and 1 tsp sugar (2 tsp for 4). Cook, stirring, until softened and jammy, 4-5 minutes. Season with salt and pepper. Turn off heat; remove from pan and set aside. Wipe out pan.


  In a medium bowl, combine beef and remaining Fry Seasoning. Form into two wide, roughly ½-inch-thick rounds (four rounds for 4 servings). Divide cheddar between centers of each round. Fold edges of meat around cheddar, shaping and sealing to create cheese-stuffed patties, each slightly wider than a burger bun. Season all over with salt and pepper.


  Heat a drizzle of oil in pan used for jam over medium-high heat. Add patties and cook to desired doneness, 3-5 minutes per side. Turn off heat.


  While patties cook, halve buns; toast until golden brown. Once garlic is done, carefully open foil and mash clove with a fork until smooth. In a small bowl, combine mayonnaise, sour cream, and mashed garlic. Season with salt and pepper.


  Spread buns with 2 TBSP ketchup (4 TBSP for 4 servings) and a thin layer of sauce. Fill buns with patties and tomato onion jam. Divide burgers and potatoes between plates. Serve with any remaining sauce on the side for dipping.
