servings: 16 pie bites
notes: |-
  * Make sure the rolls are cooked all the way. You dont want to bite into these and still have some of the crescent roll be doughy and not totally baked
  * They should be fairly firm to the touch and have nice; tan­/brown tops
  * They appeared done at the 12 minute mark but I let them go just a bit longer (14 mins total) to make sure they were totally done
directions: |-
  * Preheat oven to 375f degrees
  * Spray regular muffin tin with nonstick cooking spray
  * Unroll individual crescent roll dough pieces and lay them in individual tins
  * Put the widest bit of the dough in the bottom (you may have to do this in two batches if you only have the one muffin tin)
  * Scoop (3-4 heaping tablespoons) pie filling into each crescent roll dough piece (be generous with the pie filling its okay if a little seeps out during baking)
  * Start folding the dough around the filling as best you can (the filling doesnt have to be totally covered)
  * Bake for about 13-­14 minutes
  * Meanwhile, in a bowl whisk together powdered sugar and milk until it is smooth and reaches a desired consistency
  * With a spoon drizzle glaze over the warm bites
ingredients: |-
  * 1 (21 oz.) can cherry pie filling
  * 2 tubes crescent roll dough
  * 1 cup powdered sugar
  * 1­2 tbsp. milk
