servings: 16 pie bites
notes: 'make sure the rolls are cooked all the way. you dont want to bite into these and still have some of the crescent roll be doughy and not totally baked.
they should be fairly firm to the touch and have nice; tan­/brown tops.
they appeared done at the 12 minute mark but i let them go just a bit longer (14 mins total) to make sure they were totally done.'
directions: 'preheat oven to 375f degrees
spray regular muffin tin with nonstick cooking spray
unroll individual crescent roll dough pieces and lay them in individual tins
put the widest bit of the dough in the bottom. you may have to do this in two batches if you only have the one muffin tin
scoop (3-4 heaping tablespoons) pie filling into each crescent roll dough piece (be generous with the pie filling its okay if a little seeps out during baking) start folding the dough around the filling as best you can (the filling doesnt have to be totally covered) bake for about 13-­14 minutes for the glaze: in a bowl whisk together powdered sugar and milk until it is smooth and reaches a desired consistency with a spoon drizzle glaze over the warm bites'
ingredients: '1 (21 oz.) can cherry pie filling
2 tubes crescent roll dough
