  * Preheat oven to 400 degrees f.
  * Combine butter, pecans, brown sugar, corn syrup, salt and eggs. While constantly stirring, cook on the stovetop over medium-low heat (set on 5) just until thickened. You don’t want it dry, just slightly thickened, about the consistency of pudding. Remove from heat and set aside.
  * Unroll dough and using a 3″ cookie cutter, cut out circles. Gently fold about 1/8-1/4″ up on the edges.
  * Spoon 1 tablespoon of the pecan mixture into each circle.
  * Place on a parchment lined pan (it’s important to line it) and bake 8 minutes or until filling is just set. remove from oven and cool on a wire rack.
  * Optional: Place chocolate chips in a small ziploc bag (use brand name, the store brands tend to leak). Microwave about 15 seconds or until mostly melted. Snip off a tiny corner of the baggie and drizzle chocolate over th, cookies. Cool until set.
