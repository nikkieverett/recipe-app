  1. Begin boiling a pot of water seasoned with salt & cook the pasta for 8 minutes.

  2. While the pasta boils, in a large skillet, cook the bacon until it is crispy. A few minutes on each side.

  3. Remove the bacon and set aside on a plate to cool.

  4. In the same skillet you cooked the bacon turn the heat to medium and add the onion and garlic. Cook for about 3 minutes.

  5. Stir in ½ of the corn and cook an additional 3-4 minutes until everything is warmed through.

  6. In a high speed blender or food processor add the corn mixture, heavy cream, lemon juice, salt, and pepper. Blend well until nice and smooth.

  7. At this point the pasta should be slightly under done, reserve about 2 cups of the pasta water and strain the rest.

  8. Add the pasta to the skillet you cooked the bacon and corn in.

  9. Pour the corn sauce over the pasta and toss together. Slowly add in the reserved pasta water until the sauce reaches your desired consistency.

  10. Add in the chopped bacon, shredded chicken, the rest of the corn, and parmesan cheese. Stir well!

  11. Top with fresh basil and enjoy.
