  Don't have to use a whole pineapple... Nice presentation but unnecessary
directions: |-
  * Halve the pineapple lengthwise, right through the crown, keeping it attached
  * Put both halves cut-side up in front of you. On one of the halves, use a small sharp knife to cut into and around the perimeter of the fruit about 1/4 inch in from the peel
  * Locate the core in the center. Cut it out on an angle on either side (it will look like a long v) and discard
  * Cut the remaining pineapple into a grid of small squares
  * Use a spoon to scoop the pieces out, leaving the pineapple empty
  * Chop any large pieces a little smaller and set aside in a bowl
  * Repeat with the other pineapple half, but reserve the pieces of fruit for another use
  * Whisk together the eggs and a small pinch of salt in a small bowl
  * Heat 1 teaspoon of the oil in a large nonstick skillet over medium-high heat
  * Pour the eggs into the skillet and let them run freely until they cover most of the bottom
  * Cook, undisturbed, until the top is set and no longer runny, 4 to 5 minutes. roll up into a cylinder and transfer to a cutting board
  * Cut into thin spiral slices
  * Return the skillet to high heat and add 2 tablespoons oil. once the oil just begins to smoke, add the ham, sugar, garlic, ginger, scallion whites and 1 teaspoon of the soy sauce and cook, stirring constantly, until the ham is browned, about 2 minutes
  * Add the rice, pepper and remaining 3 tablespoons soy sauce and cook, stirring occasionally, until the rice is heated through and the pepper is crisp-tender, about 3 minutes
  * Stir in the pineapple pieces, cooked egg, most of the peanuts and scallion greens, the remaining 2 teaspoons oil and salt to taste.
  * Fill each pineapple half with the fried rice. sprinkle with the remaining peanuts and scallion greens
