servings: 8
notes:
directions: |-
. sauté meat in a large pot over medium-high heat until browned
 about five minutes. adding oil to the pan wasn’t necessary because the sausage gives off enough fat on its own.
2. add the onions and garlic to the pot and cook until the onions have softened
 about five minutes.
3. stir in the dried oregano
 crushed red pepper and the tomato paste. cook the tomato paste until it has browned slightly and evenly coated the meat and onions
 3-4 minutes.
4. add in the diced tomatoes
 bay leaves and chicken broth
 then turn down the heat to medium-low and simmer 30 minutes.
5. crank the heat back up to medium-high and bring to a boil before adding the pasta. cook until al dente according to the package directions (probably 8-10 minutes).
6. while the pasta is cooking
 mix the ricotta
 parmesan and pepper together in a little bowl.
7. once the pasta is al dente
 spoon a little of the ricotta mixture in each serving bowl
 then ladle the soup over. sprinkle with chopped basil and the shredded mozzarella.
*note:  if you’re not eating all of the soup right away
 you might want to cook the pasta separately and add it to each bowl when you serve it so the noodles don’t soak up too much of the broth. pasta will keep absorbing liquid as long as it’s available
 so you’ll find that the leftovers the next day will have turned into more pasta than soup.'
