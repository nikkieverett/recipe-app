ingredients: |-
  * 1 (8-ounce) jar diced jalapenos
  * 1 cup sugar
  * 2 (8-ounce) blocks cream cheese, softened
directions: >-
  1. At least 24 hours before serving, drain the jalapenos and add them and the
  sugar to a medium bowl. Stir to combine. Pour the mixture back into the jar
  and place the jar in the refrigerator. Shake the jar once or twice to make
  sure the sugar dissolves completely.

  2. When ready to serve, place the softened cream cheese in a large bowl. Use a mixer to beat until smooth. Drain the candied jalapenos and reserve the syrupy liquid. Add the jalapenos to the cream cheese and stir to combine. Add 2 to 3 tablespoons of the reserved liquid to the mixture to thin the dip out and to add more flavor. Spoon into a serving bowl and serve alongside assorted crackers.
