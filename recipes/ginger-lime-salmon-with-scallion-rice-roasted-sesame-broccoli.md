  4. Pat salmon dry with paper towels; season generously with salt and pepper. Heat a drizzle of oil in pan used for sesame seeds over medium-high heat. Add salmon skin sides down; cook until skin is crisp, 5-7 minutes. Flip and cook until fish is cooked through, 1-2 minutes more. Turn off heat; remove from pan and set aside. Wipe out pan.

  5. Heat a drizzle of oil in same pan over medium heat. Add scallion whites and remaining ginger; cook until ginger is fragrant, 1-2 minutes. Stir in stock concentrate, juice from half the lime, ½ tsp sugar (1 tsp for 4 servings), and ¼ cup water (⅓ cup for 4). Cook until slightly reduced, 1-2 minutes. Remove from heat and stir in 2 TBSP butter (3 TBSP for 4). Season with salt and pepper.

  6. Fluff rice with a fork; stir in 1 TBSP butter (2 TBSP for 4), lime zest, and half the scallion greens. Season with salt and pepper. Divide rice, broccoli, and salmon between plates. Top salmon with sauce and broccoli with as many sesame seeds as you like. Garnish with remaining scallion greens. Serve with remaining lime wedges on the side.
