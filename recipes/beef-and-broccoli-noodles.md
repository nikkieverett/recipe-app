  * 8 ounces dried udon, ramen, soba, lo mein noodles, or spaghetti
  * 1 large crown broccoli (10 to 12 ounces)
  * 2 cloves garlic
  * 1 (1-inch) piece fresh ginger
  * 1 1/4 cups low-sodium chicken broth, divided
  * 1/4 cup reduced-sodium soy sauce or tamari
  * 2 tablespoons oyster sauce
  * 1 tablespoon honey
  * 1 tablespoon cornstarch
  * 1 tablespoon olive oil
  * 1 pound lean ground beef
  * 1/2 teaspoon kosher salt, plus more for the noodles

directions: >-
  

  1. Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Add 8 ounces dried noodles of choice and cook for 2 minutes less than the package instructions. Drain and rinse well under cool water.

  2. Cut 1 large broccoli crown into 1-inch florets (about 3 cups). Mince 2 garlic cloves, and peel and mince 1 (1-inch) piece of fresh ginger (about 1 tablespoon). Place the garlic, ginger, 3/4 cup of the low-sodium chicken broth or water, 1/4 cup reduced-sodium soy sauce or tamari, 2 tablespoons oyster sauce, 1 tablespoon honey, and 1 tablespoon cornstarch in a medium bowl and whisk to combine.

  3. Heat 1 tablespoon olive oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat until shimmering. Add 1 pound lean ground beef and season with 1/2 teaspoon kosher salt and 1/4 teaspoon black pepper. Cook, breaking up the meat into medium pieces with a wooden spoon, until browned and cooked through, 5 to 7 minutes.

  4. Add the broccoli and remaining 1/2 cup low-sodium chicken broth or water. Stir to combine, cover, and cook until the broccoli is vibrant in color and barely crisp-tender, about 3 minutes. Whisk the sauce once more to combine. Add the sauce and the noodles to the skillet and cook, tossing regularly, until the sauce is thickened and coats the noodles well, 2 to 3 minutes. Garnish with thinly sliced scallions and toasted sesame seeds if desired.
