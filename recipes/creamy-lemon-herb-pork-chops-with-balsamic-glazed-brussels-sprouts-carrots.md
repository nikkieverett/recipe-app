ingredients: |-
  * 8 ounce Brussels Sprouts
  * 9 ounce Carrots
  * 1 clove Garlic
  * 1 unit Lemon
  * 1 tablespoon Italian Seasoning
  * 12 ounce Pork Chops
  * 1 unit Chicken Stock Concentrate
  * 2 tablespoon Cream Cheese
  * 2 tablespoon Crème Fraîche
  * 5 teaspoon Balsamic Glaze
  * 1 tablespoon Butter
directions: >-
  1. Adjust rack to top position and preheat oven to 450 degrees. Wash and dry
  produce. • Trim and halve Brussels sprouts lengthwise (quarter any larger
  sprouts). Trim, peel, and cut carrots on a diagonal into 1⁄2-inch-thick pieces
  (halve any larger carrots lengthwise first). Peel and mince or grate garlic.
  Zest and quarter lemon.

  2. Toss Brussels sprouts and carrots on a baking sheet with a large drizzle of oil, half the Italian Seasoning (you’ll use the rest in the next step), salt, and pepper. • Roast on top rack, tossing halfway through, until tender and lightly browned, 20-25 minutes.

  3. Pat pork* dry with paper towels; season all over with remaining Italian Seasoning, salt, and pepper. • Heat a large drizzle of oil in a large pan over medium-high heat. Add pork and cook until browned and cooked through, 4-6 minutes per side. TIP: Press pork down with a spatula to ensure even browning. • Turn off heat; transfer pork to a cutting board and tent with foil to keep warm. Wipe out pan.

  4. Heat a drizzle of oil in pan used for pork over medium heat. Add garlic and cook until fragrant, 30 seconds. Whisk in 1⁄3 cup water (1⁄2 cup for 4 servings), stock concentrate, cream cheese, and a squeeze of lemon juice. Simmer, whisking, until thickened, 2-3 minutes. • Remove pan from heat. Whisk in crème fraîche, 1 TBSP butter (2 TBSP for 4), and a pinch of lemon zest until combined. Season with salt and pepper.

  5. Once veggies are done, transfer to a large bowl. Add half the balsamic glaze and toss until evenly coated.

  6. Slice pork crosswise. • Divide pork and veggies between plates. Spoon sauce over pork and sprinkle with as much remaining lemon zest as you like. Drizzle veggies with as much remaining balsamic glaze as you like and serve.
