href: https://www.hellofresh.com/recipes/pork-and-veggie-bibimbap-5e67d7511082fd2292725cfc
ingredients: |-
  * ¾ cup Jasmine Rice
  * 2 unit Scallions
  * 6 ounce Carrots
  * 1 unit Zucchini
  * 1 thumb Ginger
  * 2 clove Garlic
  * 5 teaspoon White Wine Vinegar
  * 1 tablespoon Sesame Oil
  * 2 teaspoon Sriracha
  * 2 tablespoon Soy Sauce
  * 10 ounce Ground Pork
  * 1 tablespoon Sugar
  * 1 tablespoon Vegetable Oil
  * Salt
  * Pepper
directions: >-
  1. In a small pot, combine rice, 1¼ cups water (2¼ cups for 4 servings), and a
  big pinch of salt. Bring to a boil, then cover and reduce to a low simmer.
  Cook until rice is tender, 15-18 minutes. Keep covered off heat until ready to
  serve.

  2. Meanwhile, wash and dry all produce. Trim and thinly slice scallions, separating whites from greens. Trim and peel carrots. Using a peeler, shave carrots lengthwise into ribbons, rotating as you go. Trim and halve zucchini lengthwise; thinly slice crosswise into half-moons. Peel and mince ginger. Mince garlic.

  3. In a small bowl, combine scallion whites, vinegar, and a pinch of salt. Set aside to marinate, stirring occasionally, until ready to serve. In a separate small bowl, combine sesame oil, half the soy sauce (you’ll use the rest later), 1 TBSP sugar (2 TBSP for 4 servings), and up to half the sriracha to taste. Stir until sugar has dissolved.

  4. Heat a drizzle of oil in a large, preferably nonstick, pan over medium high heat. Add carrots; season with salt and pepper. Cook, stirring, until slightly softened, 3-4 minutes. Remove from pan and set aside. Add another drizzle of oil to pan. Add zucchini; season with salt and pepper. Cook until browned and tender, 3-5 minutes per side. Remove from pan and set aside with carrots.

  5. Heat another drizzle of oil in same pan over medium-high heat. Add pork, ginger, and garlic. Cook, breaking up meat into pieces, until pork is browned and cooked through, 4-6 minutes. Add remaining soy sauce and cook, stirring, until liquid has mostly evaporated, 1-2 minutes. Season with salt and pepper.

  6. Fluff rice with a fork and season with salt and pepper; divide between bowls. Arrange pork and veggies on top. Top with pickled scallion whites (and pickling liquid). Drizzle with sauce and remaining sriracha to taste. Sprinkle with scallion greens and serve.
