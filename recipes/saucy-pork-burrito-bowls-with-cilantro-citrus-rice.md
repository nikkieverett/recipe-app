ingredients: |-
  * ½ cup Jasmine Rice
  * 1 unit Yellow Onion
  * 1 unit Poblano Pepper
  * 10 ounce Ground Pork
  * 1 unit Tex-Mex Paste
  * 1 unit Roma Tomato
  * 1 unit Lemon
  * ¼ ounce Cilantro
  * 2 tablespoon Smoky Red Pepper Crema
directions: >-
  1. In a small pot, combine rice, ¾ cup water (1½ cups for 4 servings), and a
  pinch of salt. Bring to a boil, then cover and reduce to a low simmer. Cook
  until rice is tender, 15-18 minutes. • Keep covered off heat until ready to
  serve.

  2. While rice cooks, wash and dry produce. • Finely dice tomato. Halve, peel, and cut onion into ½-inch-thick wedges; mince one wedge until you have 1 TBSP (2 TBSP for 4 servings). Zest and quarter lemon. Core, deseed, and dice poblano into ½-inch pieces. Mince cilantro.

  3. In a small bowl, combine tomato, minced onion, and a big squeeze of lemon juice. Season with salt. • Add smoky red pepper crema to a separate small bowl. Stir in water 1 tsp at a time until mixture reaches a drizzling consistency.

  4. Heat a drizzle of oil in a medium pan (use a large pan for 4 servings) over medium-high heat. Add poblano and onion wedges. Season with salt. Cook, stirring occasionally, until softened and lightly charred, 7-9 minutes. • Transfer to a plate.

  5. Heat a drizzle of oil in same pan over medium-high heat. Add pork* and a big pinch of salt. Cook, breaking up meat into pieces, until browned, 4-6 minutes. • Stir in Tex-Mex paste and ¼ cup water (1/3 cup for 4 servings) until combined. Bring to a simmer and cook until mixture is saucy and pork is cooked through, 1-2 minutes more.

  6. Fluff rice with a fork; stir in lemon zest and half the cilantro. Season with salt and pepper. TIP: Stir in 1 TBSP butter (2 TBSP for 4 servings) for extra richness. • Divide rice between bowls and top with veggies, pork, salsa, crema, remaining cilantro, and any remaining sauce from pan. Serve with remaining lemon wedges on the side.
