href: https://www.hellofresh.com/recipes/gravy-smothered-meatballs-5eb08242702289132e355a82
ingredients: |-
  * 1 Yellow Onion
  * ¼ ounce Chives
  * 12 ounce Yukon Gold Potatoes
  * 6 ounce Green Beans
  * 4 tablespoon Sour Cream
  * 10 ounce Ground Beef
  * ¼ cup Panko Breadcrumbs
  * 1 tablespoon Fry Seasoning (equal parts garlic, onion & paprika)
  * 1 tablespoon Flour
  * 1 Beef Stock Concentrate (bouillon cube)
  * 1 tablespoon Vegetable Oil
  * 3 tablespoon Butter
  * Salt
  * Pepper
directions: >-
  * Adjust rack to top position (top and middle positions for 4 servings) and
  preheat oven to 425 degrees. Wash and dry all produce. Dice potatoes into
  ½-inch pieces. (TIP: For a smoother texture, peel potatoes first.) Finely chop
  chives. Halve, peel, and thinly slice onion; mince a few slices until you have
  2 TBSP (4 TBSP for 4). Trim green beans, if necessary.

  * Place potatoes in a medium pot with enough salted water to cover by 2 inches. Bring to a boil; cook until tender, 15-20 minutes. Reserve ½ cup potato cooking liquid, then drain and return potatoes to pot. Mash with sour cream and 1 TBSP butter (2 TBSP for 4 servings) until smooth, adding splashes of reserved potato cooking liquid as needed. Stir in half the chives, salt, and pepper. Keep covered off heat.

  * While potatoes cook, in a medium bowl, combine beef, panko, minced onion, 1 TBSP water (2 TBSP for 4 servings), half the Fry Seasoning (you’ll use the rest later), salt (we used ½ tsp kosher salt; 1 tsp for 4), and a pinch of pepper. Form into 10-12 (20-24 for 4) 1½-inch meatballs.

  * Place meatballs on one side of a lightly oiled baking sheet. Toss green beans on empty side with a drizzle of oil, salt, and pepper. Roast on top rack until meatballs are cooked through and green beans are browned and tender, 14-16 minutes. (For 4 servings, divide between 2 sheets; roast meatballs on middle rack and green beans on top rack.)

  * Meanwhile, melt 1 TBSP butter (2 TBSP for 4 servings) in a large pan over medium-high heat. Add sliced onion; cook, stirring, until softened, 7-9 minutes. Add a drizzle of oil, half the flour (all the flour for 4), and remaining Fry Seasoning; cook, stirring, until lightly browned, 1-2 minutes. Whisk in ¾ cup water (1½ cups for 4) and stock concentrate. Bring to a simmer, whisking, until thickened, 2-4 minutes. Reduce heat to low; stir in another 1 TBSP butter.

  * Season gravy with salt and pepper. Add meatballs and stir to coat. (TIP: If gravy seems too thick, stir in a splash of water.) Turn off heat. Divide potatoes between plates; top with meatballs and gravy. Add green beans to the side. Garnish with remaining chives and serve.
