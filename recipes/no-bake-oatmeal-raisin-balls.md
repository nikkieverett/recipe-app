notes: |-
  * I usually need 2-3 tablespoons of water to get the mixture to come together. It will depend on how dry your dates are. Add a bit at a time and wait till the mixture sticks to itself so you can roll it into balls.
  * It also helps to wet your palms with a little bit of water before rolling these up.
  * Store extra cookie balls in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to 5 days
