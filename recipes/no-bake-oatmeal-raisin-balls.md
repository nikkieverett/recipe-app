recipe notes
i usually need 2-3 tablespoons of water to get the mixture to come together. it will depend on how dry your dates are. add a bit at a time and wait till the mixture sticks to itself so you can roll it into balls.
it also helps to wet your palms with a little bit of water before rolling these up.
store extra cookie balls in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to 5 days.'
