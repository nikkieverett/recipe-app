href: https://www.tlc.com/tlcme/7-chicken-dinner-winners/
ingredients: |-
  * 1/4 lb hot italian sausage with the casing removed
  * 1 yellow onion, minced
  * 2 ounces fresh mozzarella cheese, chopped
  * 2 tbsp breadcrumbs
  * 6 boneless, skinless chicken breast halves
  * 1/2 cup dry white wine
  * salt and pepper
  * 12 toothpicks
directions: >-
  * Preheat your oven to 400 degrees

  * Saute the sausage in a pan over medium heat for about 10 minutes, or until its almost cooked

  * Meanwhile, mince one yellow onion

  * Add the onion to the sausage so that the onion soaks up some of its flavors, about 5 minutes

  * Dice the mozzarella into small chunks and add it to a medium-sized mixing bowl and add two tablespoons of breadcrumbs

  * Season to taste with a pinch of salt and some black pepper

  * Take the sausage and onions off the heat and add it to your mozzarella mixture

  * Take each chicken breast half and place it on the cutting board with the fat side facing you

  * Using a paring knife, cut into the thickest part of the meat to create a pocket, taking care not to cut all the way through

  * Add a spoonful of the stuffing, and use one of your toothpicks to fasten the two sides of the chicken breast together

  * Do the same thing with the other five chicken breasts

  * Place your chicken in an oven-safe pan, season with salt and pepper and drizzle with a little olive oil and 1/2 cup white wine

  * Cook them at 400 degrees for 20 minutes
