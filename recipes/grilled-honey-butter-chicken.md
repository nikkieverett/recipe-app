directions: >-
  

  1. Heat the grill to the highest setting.

  2. Season the chicken all over with the salt, pepper, smoked paprika and garlic powder. Once the grill is hot, place the chicken on the grates. Grill for 5 to 6 minutes before turning it and grilling for 5 to 6 minutes more.

  3. While the chicken is on the grill, combine the butter, honey and garlic in a saucepan over medium heat. Heat until the butter melts and the mixture is bubbling. Once the butter melts, from the pan from the heat. Take it out to the grill and brush the chicken with the mixture. Turn it and brush again. Repeat this once or twice more.

  4. Remove the chicken from the grill and brush with more of the honey butter. Serve with your favorite summer sides!
