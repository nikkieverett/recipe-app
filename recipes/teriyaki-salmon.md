ingredients: |-
  * 1 thumb Ginger
  * 2 unit Scallions
  * 1 unit Lime
  * 6 ounce Green Beans
  * ¾ cup Jasmine Rice
  * 10 ounce Skin-on Salmon
  * 4 ounce Teriyaki Sauce
  * 1 tablespoon Sesame Seeds
directions: >-
  1. Wash and dry all produce. Preheat oven to 400 degrees. Peel ginger, then
  mince until you have 2 tsp. Trim, then thinly slice scallions, keeping greens
  and whites separate. Cut lime into wedges. Place rice in a fine mesh sieve and
  rinse under running water.

  2. Heat a drizzle of olive oil in a medium pot over medium heat. Add ginger and scallion whites and cook, tossing, until fragrant, 1-2 minutes. Add rice and toss to coat. Pour in 1¼ cups water and add a large pinch of salt. Cover, bring to a boil, then lower heat and let simmer until water is absorbed, 15-20 minutes.

  3. Meanwhile, place salmon skin-side down in the center of a baking sheet and season with salt and pepper. Sprinkle each fillet with a drizzle of olive oil. Toss green beans with a drizzle of olive oil, salt, and pepper on same sheet. Roast in oven until salmon is opaque on surface but not cooked through, about 5 minutes.

  4. While salmon and green beans roast, place teriyaki sauce in a small pan over medium heat. Bring to a simmer and let bubble until thick and glaze-like, about 3 minutes. Set aside 2 TBSP sauce for brushing the fish and reserve the rest for serving, keeping the two separate.

  5. After salmon and green beans have roasted 5 minutes, remove baking sheet from oven. Heat broiler to high. Brush 1 TBSP teriyaki sauce onto one salmon fillet, then sprinkle with sesame seeds. Repeat with other fillet. Place sheet under broiler and broil until salmon is cooked to desired doneness and green beans are lightly browned, 3-4 minutes.

  6. Fluff rice with a fork, then season with salt, pepper, and a squeeze of lime. Divide between plates, then top with salmon and green beans. Garnish with scallion greens. Serve with lime wedges and reserved teriyaki sauce on the side for drizzling over.
