  * ½ ounce Pecans

directions: >-
  1. Adjust rack to top position and preheat oven to 425 degrees. Wash and dry
  produce. • Grate potatoes on the largest holes of a box grater. Halve and peel
  onion; grate on the largest holes of a box grater until you have 1⁄4 cup (1⁄2
  cup for 4 servings). (Save remaining onion for another use.) Finely chop
  chives. Halve, core, and thinly slice apple.

  2. Place potatoes and grated onion in the center of a clean kitchen towel; gather into a tight bundle and wring over the sink to remove excess moisture. • In a medium bowl (large bowl for 4 servings), combine grated potato mixture, 1⁄3 cup water (2⁄3 cup for 4), 1⁄4 cup tempura batter mix (1⁄2 cup for 4), a big pinch of salt, and pepper. TIP: Potato mixture should be sticky and adhere to itself when pressed together—if too dry, add water 1 tsp at a time; if too wet, add tempura batter mix 1 tsp at a time.

  3. In a small bowl, combine sour cream and half the chives. • In a separate small microwave-safe bowl, combine jam, stock concentrates, 1⁄4 tsp thyme, 2 tsp vinegar, and 1 tsp water. (For 4 servings, use 1⁄2 tsp thyme, 4 tsp vinegar, and 2 tsp water.) Microwave for 45 seconds until warmed through. Stir in 1 TBSP butter (2 TBSP for 4) until melted. Season cranberry sauce with salt and pepper. Cover bowl with plastic wrap to keep warm. • In a large bowl, combine mustard, remaining vinegar, 2 TBSP olive oil (4 TBSP for 4), and 1 tsp sugar (2 tsp for 4). Season dressing with salt and pepper.

  4. Pat chicken* dry with paper towels; season all over with salt and pepper. • Heat a drizzle of oil in a large, preferably nonstick, pan over high heat. Once oil is hot, add chicken and sear on one side until golden brown on bottom, 2-3 minutes. • Turn off heat; transfer chicken, seared sides up, to a baking sheet. Roast on top rack until cooked through, 12-18 minutes. Wash out pan.

  5. While chicken roasts, heat a 1⁄3-inch layer of oil in same pan over medium-high heat. Once oil is hot enough that a drop of potato mixture sizzles when added to the pan, carefully add heaping 1 TBSP scoops of potato mixture to pan; press down lightly with the back of a spoon to form 1⁄4-inch-thick pancakes. Cook until golden brown, 2-3 minutes per side. TIP: Don’t crowd the pan! You may need to work in batches. Lower heat to medium if browning too quickly. • Transfer potato pancakes to a paper-towel- lined plate. Season immediately with salt.

  6. Add mixed greens, apple, cheddar, and pecans to bowl with dressing. Toss to coat; taste and season with salt and pepper. • Reheat cranberry sauce in microwave for 10-15 seconds if necessary. • Slice chicken crosswise. • Divide chicken, potato pancakes, and salad between plates. Spoon cranberry sauce over chicken; sprinkle chicken and potato pancakes with remaining chives. Serve with chive sour cream on the side for dipping.
