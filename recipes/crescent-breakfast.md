notes: >-
  * Did you know? You can make scrambled eggs in the microwave! Beat eggs well
  in medium microwavable bowl. Microwave uncovered on High 1 1/2 minutes. Stir
  cooked out edges into center. Microwave 1 to 2 minutes more or until eggs are
  almost set but still moist.

  * Swap the cheddar cheese in this recipe for your favorite easy-to-melt variety: Pepper Jack, Monterey Jack, Swiss or Havarti are all tasty options.

  * Brushing the tops of the sandwiches with beaten egg gives them added golden-brown color and a crisper, slightly shiny crust.
