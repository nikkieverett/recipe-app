href: https://cookieandkate.com/best-pimento-cheese-recipe/#tasty-recipes-34451-jump-target
ingredients: >-
  * 2 cups freshly grated extra-sharp Cheddar cheese

  * 8 ounces cream cheese, cut into 1” cubes and softened at room temperature*

  * 4 ounces pimento peppers\*\*, well drained and chopped if in strips

  * 2 tablespoons mayonnaise (Duke’s is traditional but I also like Sir Kensington’s)

  * ¼ teaspoon garlic powder

  * ¼ teaspoon onion powder

  * ¼ teaspoon ground cayenne pepper (decrease or omit if sensitive to spice)

  * ½ medium jalapeño pepper, ribs and seeds removed, and minced (about 1 tablespoon; omit if sensitive to spice)

  * Freshly ground black pepper, to taste

  * Salt, to taste
directions: >-
  

  1. In a large mixing bowl or the bowl of your stand mixer, combine the cheddar, cream cheese, pimento peppers, mayonnaise, garlic powder, onion powder, cayenne pepper and jalapeño (if using), and several twists of black pepper.

  2. Beat the mixture together with a hand mixer, your stand mixer, or by hand with a sturdy wooden spoon or spatula. Beat until the mixture is thoroughly combined.

  3. Taste, and add more black pepper if desired, and/or salt for more overall flavor (I usually add a pinch of two). If you’d like your pimento cheese to have more of a kick, add another pinch of cayenne. Blend again.

  4. Transfer the mixture to a smaller serving bowl. Serve your pimento cheese immediately, or chill it in the refrigerator for up to 1 week. Pimento cheese hardens as it cools; let it rest for 30 minutes at room temperature to soften.
