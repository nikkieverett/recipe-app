directions: |-
  * In a large skillet over medium-low heat, heat the butter with garlic until melted
  * Continue to heat until the butter foams, stirring constantly to prevent overflowing
  * Once the foam subsides, continue to heat until brown bits form at the bottom of the skillet and a nutty aroma is produced
  * Add the pork chops and cook on each side until cooked through (3-5 minutes per side, or until internal temperature reached 145Â°F)
  * Remove the cooked chops to a clean plate and tent loosely with foil
  * Lower the heat to low and add the mushrooms, oregano, and thyme to the butter mixture
  * Cook until the mushrooms are slightly softened and cooked
  * Whisk in the flour until no lumps remain
  * Slowly stir in the milk until the desired gravy consistency is achieved
  * Season with salt and pepper to taste
  * (With the heat still on low) return the pork chops to the gravy for about 5 minutes
  * Serve and enjoy!
