ingredients: |-
  

  * 1 cup orange marmalade

  * ½ teaspoon ground black pepper

  1. Preheat the oven to 350° F. Combine all ingredients except for the nuts and salmon in a large bowl.

  2. Pour half of the mixture into a container with the salmon and marinate for 30 minutes. Discard the marinade.

  3. Pour the other half of the mixture into a small sauce pan set over medium high heat and bring to a boil. Stirring frequently, reduce the mixture until it thickens into a glaze but is still pourable. This will take about 5 - 8 minutes. Stir in the nuts.

  4. Place the salmon on a foil lined pan. Baked for 15 - 20 minutes, or until salmon flakes easily with a fork.

  5. Pour the reduced sauce with nuts over the cooked salmon and serve.
