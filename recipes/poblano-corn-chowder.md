ingredients: |-
  * 1/4 cup olive oil
  * 3 large carrots, cut into 1/2-inch dice
  * 2 large onions, cut into 1/2-inch dice
  * 5 stalks celery, cut into 1/2-inch pieces
  * 1/8 cup minced garlic
  * 2 to 3 small poblano peppers, seeded and cut into 1/2-inch dice
  * 1 teaspoon salt
  * 1/2 teaspoon white pepper
  * 1/4 teaspoon ground cumin, or more to taste
  * 1/4 teaspoon dried thyme, or more to taste
  * 1 tablespoon chicken bouillon granules
  * 3 quarts chicken broth
  * 1/2 bunch fresh cilantro leaves, minced

  * 1/2 cup (1 stick) unsalted butter
  * 1 cup all-purpose flour
  * 1/2 teaspoon hot sauce, or more to taste
  * 1 cup heavy cream
directions: >-
  1. Heat the oil in a large stockpot over medium heat. Add the carrots, onions,
  celery, garlic, poblano peppers, salt, white pepper, cumin, and thyme. Saute
  for 7 to 8 minutes, or until the vegetables begin to soften. Stir in the
  chicken bouillon. Add the chicken broth and cilantro, and cook for 10 to 12
  minutes, or until the carrots are tender. Stir in the chicken and cook,
  stirring frequently, until the chowder is thick and the chicken is heated
  through. Shortly before the chowder is done, melt the butter in a large
  skillet over medium heat. Add the flour and stir to combine. Cook, stirring
  frequently, for 3 to 4 minutes to cook the flour. Do not allow the mixture to
  brown! Ladle 1 cup of the hot liquid from the stockpot into the skillet,
  whisking constantly.

  2. When the first cup of liquid is incorporated, add another 2 cups of liquid, 1 at a time. Pour the mixture in the skillet into the stockpot, whisking to blend. Cook, stirring frequently, for 3 to 5 minutes longer, or until the mixture begins to thicken. Remove the pot from the heat. Stir in the hot sauce, then the cream, and serve.
