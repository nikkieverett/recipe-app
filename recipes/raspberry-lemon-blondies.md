directions: >-
  

  1. Preheat oven to 350 degrees Fahrenheit. Line a 9×13-inch pan with parchment paper and set aside.

  2. In a large bowl or stand mixer, cream together butter, granulated sugar, and brown sugar- about 2 minutes. Add eggs, lemon juice, vanilla extract, and lemon zest and beat until it becomes light and fluffy- about 3 minutes.

  3. In a medium bowl, mix together flour, baking powder, and salt. Add the flour mixture to the butter mixture and stir until just combined. Gently fold the raspberries into the batter.

  4. Spread batter into the baking pan and bake for 25-30 minutes until the edges are golden brown and a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean. Remove from oven and allow to fully cool.


  #### Glaze


  1. To make raspberry puree, mash 5-7 raspberries in a small bowl then strain out the seeds in a fine mesh strainer. Add in the powdered sugar. Stir in lemon juice until desired consistency. *It should be thick but pourable.* Spread over the top of cooled blondies. Allow the top to firm up before slicing. Enjoy!
