ingredients: |-
  * 1 (9 inch) deep dish pie crust 
  * 4 large tomatoes; peeled and sliced organic heirloom tomatoes 
  * 1/2 cup chopped fresh basil 
  * 3 green onions; thinly sliced 
  * 1/2 pound bacon - cooked; drained; and chopped 
  * 1/2 teaspoon garlic powder 
  * 1 teaspoon dried oregano 
  * 1/2 teaspoon crushed red pepper 
  * 2 cups shredded cheddar cheese 
  * 1/4 cup mayonnaise
directions: >-
  1. preheat oven to low broil.

  2. slice tomatoes (I usually get 4 slices per large tomato).

  3. broil tomatoes for about 30 minutes to release moisture.

  4. drain on paper towels.

  5. preheat oven to 375 degrees.

  6. brush beaten egg white or whole egg onto the sides and bottom of pie shells (for single-crust pies).

  7. in alternating layers; fill pastry shell with tomatoes; basil; scallions; bacon; garlic powder; oregano; and red pepper. 

  8. in a small bowl; mix cheese with mayonnaise. spread mixture over top of pie. 

  9. cover loosely with aluminum foil.

  10. bake in preheated oven for 30 minutes. bake your pie in the lower third of the oven. this will allow the bottom crust to become crisp while the top shouldn't get overly browned. 

  11. remove foil from top of pie and bake an additional 30 minutes. 

  12. serve warm or cold.
