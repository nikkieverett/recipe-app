notes:
directions: 'i mix mine in the mornings
 let sit until i finish dinner and pop it in the oven before we sit down to eat : )
in a large mixing bowl add eggs and slightly beat.
add everything but the bread and pecans. mix well until it is combined really good.
fold in bread and half the pecans.
let sit at room temperature for 1 hour mixing every so often to coat bread well. cover and refrigerate until you are ready to bake. this recipe is best if left to sit for 6-8 hours or overnight. it gives the bread plenty of time to soak everything up!
preheat oven to 350 degrees. prepare a 9x13 baking dish with butter or cooking spray. (i use a little smaller size because i like a thicker bread pudding.) use whatever size you want : )
pour everything into your prepared baking dish.
top with remaining pecans.
pop in the oven and bake for 60 minutes.

rum sauce:  while bread pudding is baking
 in a saucepan melt stick of butter.
add sugar
 dark rum or bourbon
 and water. mix well and simmer for 10 minutes stirring occasionally. turn stove eye off and let sit to keep warm until bread pudding is finished.
remove from oven.
while still hot
 pour half the rum sauce over the top. letting it get down between the pudding and sides of baking dish.
let sit for 15 minutes and pour more sauce over it. you judge how much of the sauce you want - some or all it is up to you. i use it all
 lol.
enjoy! i like mine warm with vanilla ice cream and hubby eats his with fresh whipped topping.
