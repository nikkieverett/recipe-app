notes: |-
  * This recipe is best if left to sit for 6-8 hours or overnight, it gives the bread plenty of time to soak everything up!
  * I mix mine in the mornings let sit until I finish dinner and pop it in the oven before we sit down to eat
directions: |-
  * In a large mixing bowl add eggs and slightly beat
  * Add everything but the bread and pecans
  * Mix well until it is combined really good
  * Fold in bread and half the pecans
  * Let sit at room temperature for 1 hour mixing every so often to coat bread well
  * Cover and refrigerate until you are ready to bake
  * Preheat oven to 350 degrees
  * Prepare a 9x13 baking dish with butter or cooking spray. (i use a little smaller size because i like a thicker bread pudding.)
  * Pour everything into your prepared baking dish
  * Top with remaining pecans
  * Pop in the oven and bake for 60 minutes
  * While bread pudding is baking, in a saucepan melt stick of butter.
  * Add sugar, dark rum or bourbon, and water
  * Mix well and simmer for 10 minutes stirring occasionally
  * Turn stove eye off and let sit to keep warm until bread pudding is finished
  * Remove from oven
  * While still hot pour half the rum sauce over the top
  * Letting it get down between the pudding and sides of baking dish
  * Let sit for 15 minutes and pour more sauce over it (you judge how much of the sauce you want - some or all it is up to you.)
  * Enjoy! I like mine warm with vanilla ice cream and hubby eats his with fresh whipped topping
