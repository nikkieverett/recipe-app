ingredients: >-
  * 12 large (about 4 pounds) tomatoes, stemmed and quartered

  * 1/2 cup extra-virgin olive oil, divided

  * 1/4 cup good-quality balsamic vinegar

  * 12 large garlic cloves, peeled

  * salt

  * 1/2 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper

  * 1 cup chopped yellow onions

  * 2 cups lightly packed fresh basil leaves, plus few leaves torn for garnish

  * 2 cups chicken broth*

    \*(alternatively - not as healthy, but very tasty - 1 c chicken broth & 1 c heavy cream)

  For the bruschetta:


  * 1 loaf country-style bread

  * extra-virgin olive oil
directions: >-
  * Preheat the oven to 500 degrees f

  * In a large bowl, mix the tomatoes, 1/4 cup of the oil, the vinegar, garlic, salt, and pepper, to taste

  * Spread the tomatoes out on a non-reactive baking sheet, roast the tomatoes in the oven until very dark in spots, 35 to 40 minutes

  * Remove and allow to cool a bit

  * Cut the bread crosswise into slices about 1-inch thick (you will need 8 slices)

  * Lightly brush the slices on both sides with oil and season with salt

  * Place the slices on a baking sheet and toast in the oven until the bruschetta are golden brown and just beginning to crisp, about 6 minutes

  * In a large saucepan over medium heat, combine remaining 1/4 cup oil, the onions, and a pinch of salt

  * Cook until the onions are very soft, 8 to 10 minutes, stirring occasionally

  * Add the 2 cups basil leaves and saute with the onions for about 1 minute

  * Add the roasted tomatoes and water to the saucepan

  * Bring the mixture to a simmer and cook for 10 minutes, season with salt and pepper, to taste

  * Puree the tomato mixture in a blender, start the motor at a slow speed and increase gradually. You should have about 8 cups

  * You can prepare the soup to this point and refrigerate it

  * When ready, serve, pour the soup into a medium saucepan and bring it to a slow simmer over medium heat

  * Serve the soup. Place 1 bruschetta in the center of each shallow soup bowl

  * Pour the soup around each bruschetta, garnish with torn basil leaves
