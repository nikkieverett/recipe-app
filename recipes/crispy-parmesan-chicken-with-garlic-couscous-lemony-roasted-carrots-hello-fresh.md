ingredients: |-
  * 12 ounce Carrots
  * 2 Scallions
  * 1 Lemon
  * ¼ cup Panko Breadcrumbs
  * ¼ cup Parmesan Cheese
  * 1 teaspoon Hot Smoked Paprika
  * 10 ounce Chicken Cutlets
  * 2 tablespoon Sour Cream
  * ½ cup Israeli Couscous
  * 2 tablespoon Garlic Herb Butter
  * 4 teaspoon Olive Oil
  * Salt
  * Pepper
directions: >-
  * Adjust rack to middle position (middle and top positions for 4 servings) and
  preheat oven to 425 degrees. Bring a medium pot of salted water to a boil.
  Wash and dry all produce. Trim, peel, and halve carrots; cut crosswise into
  2-inch-thick pieces. Trim and thinly slice scallions, separating whites from
  greens. Zest and quarter lemon.

  * In a small bowl, combine panko, Parmesan, paprika, a large drizzle of olive oil, and a pinch of salt and pepper. Pat chicken dry with paper towels; season all over with salt and pepper. Place on one side of a baking sheet (for 4 servings, spread out across entire sheet). Spread tops of chicken with sour cream. Mound with panko mixture, pressing to adhere (no need to coat the undersides).

  * Toss carrots on empty side of same sheet with a large drizzle of olive oil, salt, and pepper. (For 4 servings, toss carrots on a second sheet.) Roast on middle rack until chicken is cooked through and carrots are browned and tender, 15-20 minutes. (For 4, roast chicken on middle rack and carrots on top rack.) Transfer chicken to a plate to rest. TIP: If carrots are done before chicken, remove from sheet and continue roasting chicken.

  * Meanwhile, add couscous to pot of boiling water. Cook until tender, 6-8 minutes. Drain thoroughly. Melt garlic herb butter in empty pot over medium heat. Add scallion whites and cook until softened, 1 minute. Return couscous to pot and stir until coated. Taste and season with salt and pepper. Turn off heat.

  * Once carrots are done roasting, remove from oven and toss with lemon zest and a squeeze of lemon juice to taste.

  * Divide chicken, carrots, and couscous between plates. Garnish chicken with scallion greens. Serve with remaining lemon wedges on the side.
