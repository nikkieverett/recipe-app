ingredients: |-
  * ¼ cup Panko Breadcrumbs
  * 1 tablespoon Sesame Seeds
  * 1 teaspoon Garlic Powder
  * 1 thumb Ginger
  * ½ cup Jasmine Rice
  * 10 ounce Chicken Cutlets
  * 4 tablespoon Mayonnaise
  * 1 teaspoon Wasabi Paste
  * 1 unit Lime
  * 4 ounce Kale
  * 1 clove Garlic
  * 4 teaspoon Cooking Oil
  * ¼ teaspoon Sugar
  * 2 tablespoon Butter
directions: >-
  1. Adjust rack to top position and preheat oven to 425 degrees. • Melt 1 TBSP
  butter (2 TBSP for 4 servings) in a large pan over medium-high heat. Add
  panko, sesame seeds, garlic powder, and a pinch of salt and pepper. Cook,
  stirring, until golden and fragrant, 1-2 minutes. • Turn off heat; transfer to
  a small bowl. Wipe out pan.

  2. Wash and dry produce. • Peel and mince or grate ginger. • Heat a drizzle of oil in a small pot over medium-high heat. Add half the ginger (you’ll use the rest later) and cook until fragrant, 30 seconds. Add rice, 3⁄4 cup water (1 1⁄2 cups for 4 servings), and a big pinch of salt. Bring to a boil, then cover and reduce heat to low. Cook until rice is tender and water has evaporated, 15-18 minutes. • Keep covered off heat until ready to serve.

  3. Meanwhile, pat chicken* dry with paper towels and season all over with salt and pepper. Place on a lightly oiled baking sheet. • Evenly spread top of each cutlet with 1⁄2 TBSP mayonnaise (you’ll use the rest in the next step). Mound with toasted panko mixture, pressing firmly to adhere (no need to coat the undersides). Wipe out bowl. • Roast on top rack until chicken is golden brown and cooked through, 15-20 minutes.

  4. While chicken cooks, zest and quarter lime. Remove and discard any large stems from kale. Peel and mince or grate garlic. • In bowl used for panko, combine half the wasabi paste (all for 4 servings), remaining mayonnaise, 1⁄4 tsp sugar (1⁄2 tsp for 4), and a squeeze of lime juice. (Use less wasabi paste if you’re not a fan of heat.) Add water 1 tsp at a time until sauce reaches a drizzling consistency. Season with salt and pepper if desired.

  5. Heat a large drizzle of oil in pan used for panko over medium-high heat. Add kale and season with salt and pepper. Cook, stirring occasionally, until almost tender, 3-5 minutes. Stir in garlic and remaining ginger; cook until fragrant and kale is tender, 1-2 minutes more. • Remove pan from heat and stir in a squeeze of lime juice. Cover to keep warm.

  6. Fluff rice with a fork; stir in lime zest and 1 TBSP butter (2 TBSP for 4 servings). Season with salt and pepper. • Divide chicken, rice, and kale between plates. Serve wasabi sauce on the side for dipping chicken, along with remaining lime wedges.
