title: Meatloaves with Sweet Chili Glaze Hello Fresh
ingredients: |-
  * 2 Scallions
  * 1  Lime
  * ½ cup Jasmine Rice
  * ¼ cup Panko Breadcrumbs
  * 2 tablespoon Ketchup
  * 2 oz Ponzu Sauce
  * 1 thumb Ginger
  * 8 ounce Broccoli Florets
  * 10 ounce Ground Beef
  * 4 tablespoon Sweet Soy Glaze
  * 1 teaspoon Korean Chili Flakes
  * 1 tablespoon Sesame Seeds
  * 1 teaspoon Vegetable Oil
  * 1 tablespoon Butter
  * Salt
  * Pepper
directions: >-
  * Adjust rack to top position and preheat oven to 425 degrees. Wash and dry
  all produce.

  * Peel and mince ginger. Trim and thinly slice scallions, separating whites from greens; mince whites. Cut broccoli florets into bite-size pieces, if necessary. Quarter lime. • 4 SERVINGS: Adjust racks to top and middle positions.

  * Melt 1 TBSP butter in a small pot over medium-high heat. Add half the ginger and cook until fragrant, 30 seconds. • Add rice, ¾ cup water, and a big pinch of salt. Bring to a boil, then cover and reduce heat to low. Cook until rice is tender, 15-18 minutes. Keep covered off heat until ready to serve. • 4 SERVINGS: Use 2 TBSP butter and 1½ cups water.

  * While rice cooks, in a large bowl, combine beef*, scallion whites, panko, remaining ginger, salt (we used ¾ tsp kosher salt), and pepper. Gently combine, then form into two 1-inch-tall loaves. Place on one side of a baking sheet. • 4 SERVINGS: Use 1¼ tsp kosher salt. Form beef mixture into four loaves and spread out across entire sheet.

  * Toss broccoli on opposite side of sheet from meatloaves with a drizzle of oil. • Roast on top rack until meatloaves are cooked through and broccoli is browned and tender, 15-18 minutes. • 4 SERVINGS: Add broccoli to a second baking sheet; roast meatloaves on top rack and broccoli on middle rack.

  * Meanwhile, in a small bowl, combine sweet soy glaze, ketchup, a pinch of chili flakes to taste, and a squeeze of lime juice to taste. • In the last 2-3 minutes of roasting, remove baking sheet from oven; brush tops of meatloaves with 1 TBSP glaze mixture each. • Return to oven until glaze is tacky. • 4 SERVINGS: Leave broccoli roasting while you glaze the meatloaves. • TIP: Save any remaining glaze mixture for serving.

  * Fluff rice with a fork and season with salt and pepper. Toss broccoli with ponzu and half the sesame seeds. • Divide rice, broccoli, and meatloaves between plates. Drizzle meatloaves with any remaining glaze mixture. Garnish with scallion greens, remaining sesame seeds, and as many chili flakes as you like. Serve with remaining lime wedges on the side.
