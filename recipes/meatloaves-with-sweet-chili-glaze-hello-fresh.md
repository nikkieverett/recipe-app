ingredients: |-
  * 10 ounce Ground Beef
  * ¼ cup Panko Breadcrumbs
  * 8 ounce Broccoli Florets
  * 1 thumb Ginger
  * 1  Lime
  * ½ cup Jasmine Rice
  * 2 tablespoon Ketchup
  * 4 tablespoon Sweet Soy Glaze (recipe below)
  * 1 teaspoon Korean Chili Flakes
  * 1 tablespoon Ponzu Sauce
  * 1 tablespoon Sesame Seeds
  * 1 teaspoon Vegetable Oil
  * 1 tablespoon Butter
  * Salt
  * Pepper

    Sweet Soy Glaze

    * ⅔ cup brown sugar
    * ½ cup low-sodium soy sauce
    * ⅓ cup white sugar
    * ¼ cup water
    * 2 tablespoons white wine vinegar

      Mix all in sauce pan.  Bring to boil.  Let boil until it thickens.
directions: >-
  * Adjust rack to top position and preheat oven to 425 degrees. Wash and dry
  all produce.

  * Make soy glaze if needed.

  * Peel and mince ginger. Trim and thinly slice scallions, separating whites from greens; mince whites. Cut broccoli florets into bite-size pieces, if necessary. Quarter lime.

  * Melt butter in a small pot over medium-high heat. Add half the ginger and cook until fragrant, 30 seconds. • Add rice, water, and a big pinch of salt. Bring to a boil, then cover and reduce heat to low. Cook until rice is tender, 15-18 minutes. Keep covered off heat until ready to serve.

  * While rice cooks, in a large bowl, combine beef*, scallion whites, panko, remaining ginger, 1/2 tsp salt, and pepper. Gently combine, then form into two 1-inch-tall loaves. Place on one side of a baking sheet. Form beef mixture into four loaves and spread out across entire sheet.

  * Toss broccoli on opposite side of sheet from meatloaves with a drizzle of oil, salt and pepper. • Roast on top rack until meatloaves are cooked through and broccoli is browned and tender, 15-18 minutes. 

  * Meanwhile, in a small bowl, combine sweet soy glaze, ketchup, a pinch of chili flakes to taste, and a squeeze of lime juice to taste. • In the last 2-3 minutes of roasting, remove baking sheet from oven; brush tops of meatloaves with 1 TBSP glaze mixture each. • Return to oven until glaze is tacky.  Save any remaining glaze mixture for serving.

  * Fluff rice with a fork and season with salt and pepper. Toss broccoli with ponzu and half the sesame seeds. • Divide rice, broccoli, and meatloaves between plates. Drizzle meatloaves with any remaining glaze mixture. Garnish with scallion greens, remaining sesame seeds, and as many chili flakes as you like. Serve with remaining lime wedges on the side.
