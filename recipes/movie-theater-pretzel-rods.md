ingredients: |-
  

  * 1 package (1/4 ounce) active dry yeast
  * 1-1/2 cups warm water (110° to 115°)
  * 2 tablespoons sugar
  * 2 tablespoons butter, melted
  * 1-1/2 teaspoons salt
  * 4 to 4-1/2 cups all-purpose flour
  * 8 cups water

directions: >-
  

  1. In a large bowl, dissolve yeast in warm water. Add the sugar, butter, salt and 2 cups flour. Beat until smooth. Stir in enough remaining flour to form a soft dough (dough will be sticky).

  2. Turn dough onto a floured surface; knead until smooth and elastic, 6-8 minutes. Place in a greased bowl, turning once to grease top. Cover and let rise in a warm place until doubled, about 1 hour.

  3. In a large saucepan, bring 8 cups water and the baking soda to a boil. Punch dough down; divide into 32 portions. Roll each into a 5-in. log. Add to boiling water, a few at a time; cook 30 seconds. Remove with a slotted spoon; drain on paper towels.

  4. Place on greased [baking sheets](https://amzn.to/2LlenxW). Lightly beat egg yolk and cold water; brush over pretzels. If desired, sprinkle with coarse salt. Bake at 425° until golden brown, 9-11 minutes. Remove from pans to wire racks. Serve warm with cheese sauce if desired.
