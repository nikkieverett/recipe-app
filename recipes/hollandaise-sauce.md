ingredients: >-
  * 3 egg yolks

  * 1 tablespoon lemon juice,or more as desired for flavor

  * 1 teaspoon Dijon mustard

  * 1/4 teaspoon salt

  * pinch of cayenne pepper

  * 1/2 cup unsalted butter or ghee,or more for a thinner consistency, melted and hot
directions: >-
  1. Melt the butter in a microwave (make sure it's covered as it will splatter)
  for about 1 minute, until it's hot. Alternatively, you could heat it on the
  stove.

  2. Add the egg yolks, lemon juice, dijon, salt and cayenne pepper into a high powered blender and blend for 5 seconds until combined.

  3. With the blender running on medium high, slowly stream in the hot butter into the mixture until it's emulsified.

  4. Pour the hollandaise sauce into a small bowl and serve while warm.


  ### TIPS


  * Butter needs to be hot, not just melted. The recipe will not emulsify with luke warm butter.

  * If you'd like more sauce, just add another yolk and up to another 1/2 cup of melted butter.
