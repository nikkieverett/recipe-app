href: https://www.hellofresh.com/recipes/white-cheddar-ranch-chicken-penne-6283b4ab65914596d7011b70
ingredients: |-
  1 Yellow Onion



  10 ounce Chicken Cutlets



  1 tablespoon Ranch Spice

  1 tablespoon Flour

  6 ounce Penne Pasta

  1 unit Chicken Stock Concentrate

  ½ cup White Cheddar Cheese

  1.5 ounce Buttermilk Ranch Dressing

  1 teaspoon Cooking Oil

  1 tablespoon Butter

  Kosher Salt

  Pepper
directions: >-
  1. Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. • Halve, peel, and thinly
  slice onion.

  2. In a medium bowl, toss half the onion with half the flour (you’ll use the rest in step 5). Season with a pinch of salt and pepper. • Heat a 1⁄3-inch layer of oil in a large, heavy- bottomed pan over medium- low heat. Once oil is hot enough that a pinch of flour sizzles when added to the pan, add floured onion. Cook, stirring occasionally, until golden brown, 7-9 minutes. • Using a slotted spoon, transfer crispy onion to a paper-towel-lined plate.

  3.  Pat chicken* dry with paper towels and season all over with half the Ranch Spice (all for 4 servings), salt, and pepper. Set aside. • While onion cooks, heat a drizzle of oil in a second large pan over medium- high heat. Add chicken and cook until browned and cooked through, 3-5 minutes per side. TIP: If chicken begins to brown too quickly, lower heat to medium and cover pan. • Turn off heat; transfer to a cutting board and tent with foil to keep warm. Wipe out pan.

  4. Once water is boiling, add penne to pot. Cook, stirring occasionally, until al dente, 9-11 minutes. • Reserve 1 cup pasta cooking water (2 cups for 4 servings), then drain.

  5. Heat 1 TBSP butter (2 TBSP for 4 servings) in pan used for chicken over medium heat. Add remaining onion and cook, stirring occasionally, until golden brown and softened, 6-9 minutes. Add a few splashes of plain water and cook until onion is caramelized and liquid has evaporated, 1-2 minutes more. • Add remaining flour and cook, stirring constantly, until flour is golden, 30-60 seconds. Slowly whisk in 3⁄4 cup reserved pasta cooking water (1 1⁄4 cups for 4) and stock concentrate; cook until thickened, 2-3 minutes more. • Remove from heat; stir in cheddar and ranch dressing until melted and combined.

  6. Add drained penne to pan with sauce and toss to coat. If needed, stir in more reserved pasta cooking water a splash at a time until pasta is coated in a creamy sauce. Taste and season with salt and pepper. • Slice chicken crosswise. • Divide pasta between bowls. Top with chicken and sprinkle with crispy onion. Serve.
