directions: 'place the chicken in the bottom of a 6-quart or larger slow cooker. in a medium mixing bowl or very large measuring cup
 whisk together the soy sauce
 honey
 tomato paste
 chili paste
 garlic
 and rice vinegar. pour over the chicken. cover and cook on low for 4 to 5 hours or high for 2 to 3 hours
 until the chicken reaches an internal temperature of 165 degrees f on an instant-read thermometer. if you are available
 flip the chicken over once halfway through to coat both sides. (if not
 don’t stress; it will still be tasty.)

remove the chicken to a plate and let cool slightly. whisk the cornstarch into the slow cooker cooking liquid. cover and cook on high for 15 minutes
 until the sauce thickens slightly
 stirring occasionally. if you'd like the sauce particularly thick
 you can cook it for a full 30 minutes in the slow cooker or follow the stovetop method below.

for quicker sauce thickening
 reduce the sauce on the stove:  after whisking in the cornstarch
 transfer the cooking liquid to a medium saucepan. cook on the stovetop over medium heat
 stirring often until the sauce thickens
 5 to 10 minutes. (if your slow cooker insert is stovetop safe
 you can remove it from the slow cooker and place it directly on the burner
 but do not do this unless you are positive your insert is stovetop safe or it may crack.)

with two forks (or your fingers if the chicken is cool enough)
 shred the chicken and place it in the slow cooker. if you reduced the sauce on the stove
 add it back to the slow cooker now. stir to coat the chicken with the sauce. serve over rice
 sprinkled with green onions and sesame seeds.'
