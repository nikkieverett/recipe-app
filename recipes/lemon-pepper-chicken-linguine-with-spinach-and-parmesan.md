href: https://www.hellofresh.com/recipes/lemon-pepper-chicken-linguine-5bad4291ae08b53d0077dcf2
ingredients: |-
  * 1 tablespoon Tricolored Peppercorns
  * 2 unit Lemon
  * 4 clove Garlic
  * 12 ounce Linguine
  * 5 ounce Spinach
  * 24 ounce Chicken Breasts
  * ½ cup Parmesan Cheese
  * 3 teaspoon Olive Oil
  * 4 tablespoon Butter
directions: >-
  1. Wash and dry all produce. Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil.
  Place peppercorns in a zip-close bag; crush using a heavy-bottomed pan or a
  rolling pin. Zest 2 tsp zest from lemons and then halve; squeeze 3 TBSP juice
  into a small bowl. Mince garlic.

  2. Once water boils, add linguine to pot. Cook until al dente, 9-11 minutes. During the last minute of cooking, stir in spinach and let wilt. Reserve 1 cup cooking water, then drain linguine and spinach. Set aside.

  3. Meanwhile, pat chicken dry with a paper towel; season all over with salt and a pinch of crushed peppercorns. Heat a large drizzle of olive oil in a large pan over medium-high heat. Add chicken and cook until browned on surface and no longer pink in center, 6-8 minutes per side. Transfer to a cutting board and let rest 5 minutes.

  4. Heat a drizzle of olive oil in pan used for chicken over medium-high heat. Add garlic, 1½ tsp lemon zest, and 1 tsp crushed peppercorns. Cook, stirring, until fragrant, about 30 seconds. Stir in reserved lemon juice and half the reserved cooking water. Bring to a simmer, then remove from heat.

  5. Thinly slice chicken once it has had 5 minutes to rest. Using tongs, toss linguine, spinach, and chicken into pan. Add 4 TBSP butter and half the Parmesan, stirring to melt. Season with salt. TIP: Everything should be coated in a loose sauce—if dry, add more cooking water a little bit at a time.

  6. Divide pasta mixture between plates. Garnish with remaining Parmesan, remaining lemon zest, and any remaining crushed peppercorns (if desired—you may want to skip this for the kids).
