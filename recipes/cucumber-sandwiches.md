ingredients: |-
  

  * 4-5 slices of bread I used whole wheat
  * 4 ounces cream cheese softened
  * 2 tablespoons ranch dressing
  * 1 large cucumber sliced thin (you'll need 16-20 slices for this recipe)
  * dried dill
directions: >-
  

  1. With a rolling pin, roll over each slice of bread so that it's about a quarter inch thick.

  2. Cut off the crust with a knife or pizza cutter. Your bread will now look like a large square. Cut each slice in half length-wise, and then again width-wise. You should now have 4 small bread squares for each slice of bread (16-20 squares total).

  3. Your cream cheese needs to be slightly warmer than room temperature, so if it's not, place it in a microwaveable bowl and microwave for 30-45 seconds.

  4. Mix the ranch dressing into the cream cheese.

  5. Spread the cream cheese mixture onto each small bread square.

  6. Place a cucumber slice on top of each bread square.

  7. Sprinkle each cucumber sandwich with just a tiny pinch of dill.

  8. Refrigerate until cream cheese is set. Serve cool.
