title: Cesar Crunch Chicken - Hello Fresh
href: https://www.hellofresh.com/recipes/caesar-crunch-chicken-6142108d5a5f4243a879978a
ingredients: |-
  * 9 ounce Carrots
  * 1 tablespoon Italian Seasoning
  * 10 ounce Chicken Cutlets
  * 1.5 ounce Caesar Dressing
  * ¼ cup Panko Breadcrumbs
  * ½ cup Parmesan Cheese
  * 6 ounce Green Beans
  * 1 teaspoon Olive Oil
  * 2 teaspoon Cooking Oil
  * Salt
  * Pepper
directions: >-
  1. Adjust racks to middle and top positions and preheat oven to 425 degrees.
  Lightly oil a baking sheet. (TIP: To prevent sticking, line baking sheet with
  parchment paper first.) Wash and dry produce. • Trim, peel, and halve carrots
  lengthwise; cut into green- bean-sized pieces.

  2.  In a medium bowl, combine panko, half the Parmesan (you’ll use the rest later), 1 tsp Italian Seasoning (2 tsp for 4 servings), a drizzle of olive oil, salt, and pepper. (Be sure to measure the Italian Seasoning; we sent more.)

  3. Pat chicken* dry with paper towels; season all over with salt and pepper. Place on one side of prepared baking sheet. • Evenly brush tops of chicken with a thin layer of Caesar dressing (save the rest for serving). Mound coated sides with panko mixture, pressing to adhere (no need to coat the undersides). • Roast on middle rack for 10 minutes (you’ll add more to the sheet then).

  4. Meanwhile, toss green beans and carrots on a second baking sheet with a drizzle of oil, salt, and pepper. • Roast on top rack until tender and lightly browned, 15-20 minutes.

  5. Once chicken has roasted 10 minutes, remove sheet from oven. Evenly sprinkle remaining Parmesan into a 6-inch-wide circle on empty side of same sheet. (For 4 servings, sprinkle Parmesan into two 6-inch-wide circles.) • Return to middle rack until chicken is browned and cooked through and frico is golden brown, 5-10 minutes. TIP: Keep a close eye on the frico to avoid burning and check on it after 5 minutes—if it’s golden brown, remove it from the sheet and continue roasting chicken. • Set chicken aside to rest. Let frico cool until crispy, then transfer to a paper-towel-lined plate.

  6. Break frico into bite-size pieces; toss with green beans and carrots. • Divide veggies and chicken between plates. Drizzle remaining dressing over chicken (or serve on the side for dipping).
