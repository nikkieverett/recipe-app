directions: 'while the pasta is cooking
 melt the butter in a large frying pan. add a pinch of salt if the butter is unsalted.

add in the lemon juice and the fresh peas. fresh peas take but a few seconds to cook.
when the pasta is done cooking
 using a slotted spoon
 scoop out the raviolis and transfer them directly to the fry pan with the sauce.

it works best if you can time it so the peas are cooked when the pasta is done. the liquid from the pasta will make the butter sauce even creamier
 so dont worry about the raviolis being wet when you add them to the butter.

cook everything for a few seconds and then plate with fresh parmesan cheese and salt and pepper.'
ingredients: '3 ounces peas
