servings: 2-4 servings
notes:
directions: |-
  * While the pasta is cooking, melt the butter in a large frying pan (add a pinch of salt if the butter is unsalted)
  * Add in the lemon juice and the fresh peas (fresh peas take but a few seconds to cook)
  * When the pasta is done cooking, using a slotted spoon, scoop out the raviolis and transfer them directly to the fry pan with the sauce
  * It works best if you can time it so the peas are cooked when the pasta is done
  * The liquid from the pasta will make the butter sauce even creamier, so dont worry about the raviolis being wet when you add them to the butter
  * Cook everything for a few seconds and then plate with fresh parmesan cheese and salt and pepper
ingredients: |-
  * 3 ounces peas
  * 3 tablespoons butter
  * 1/2 teaspoon lemon juice
  * parmesan cheese
  * salt and pepper to taste
