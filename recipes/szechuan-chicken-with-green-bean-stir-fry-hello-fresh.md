    2 tablespoons white wine vinegar

    2 tablespoons rice vinegar

    ½ teaspoon ground ginger
directions: >-
  1. Wash and dry all produce. • Peel and mince or grate ginger. Trim green
  beans, if necessary; cut crosswise into 2-inch pieces. Trim and thinly slice
  scallions, separating whites from greens.

  2. Melt 1 TBSP butter in a small pot over medium-high heat. Add half the ginger; cook, stirring, until fragrant, 1 minute. • Stir in rice, 2¼ cups water, and a big pinch of salt. Bring to a boil, then cover and reduce to a low simmer. Cook until rice is tender, 15-18 minutes. Keep covered off heat until ready to serve. 

  3. Meanwhile, place green beans in a medium microwave-safe bowl. Add a splash of water, then cover with plastic wrap. Microwave until tender, 1-2 minutes. Uncover, drain, and set aside. 

  4. Heat a large, preferably nonstick, pan over medium-high heat. Add peanuts, 1 tsp sugar, and 2TBS water. Cook, stirring, until water has evaporated and peanuts are coated and lightly toasted, 3-5 minutes. Turn off heat; transfer to a small bowl. Wash out pan. 

  5. Pat chicken* dry with paper towels. • Heat a drizzle of oil in pan used for peanuts over medium-high heat. Add chicken and cook, stirring occasionally, until browned and cooked through, 4-6 minutes.

  6. Stir green beans, scallion whites, remaining ginger, and 2 tsp sugar into pan with chicken. Cook, scraping up any browned bits from bottom of pan, until ginger is fragrant, 1 minute.

  7. Stir in Szechuan paste, sweet soy glaze, and 1/3 cup water. Cook, stirring, until everything is thoroughly coated in sauce, 1-2 minutes. Remove pan from heat. • TIP: If ginger and scallions begin to brown too quickly, reduce heat to medium low.

  8. Fluff rice with a fork; season with salt and pepper. Taste chicken stir-fry and season with salt and pepper. • Divide rice between bowls and top with chicken stir-fry. Sprinkle with scallion greens and peanuts. Serve.
