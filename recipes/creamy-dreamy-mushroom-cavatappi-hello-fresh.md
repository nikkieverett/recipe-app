href: https://www.hellofresh.com/recipes/creamy-dreamy-mushroom-cavatappi-615db91989293e20f9171d99
ingredients: |-
  * 2 unit Scallions
  * 8 ounce Cremini Mushrooms
  * 6 ounce Cavatappi Pasta
  * 1 tablespoon Flour
  * 6.75 ounce Milk
  * 2 tablespoon Cream Cheese
  * 2 tablespoon Garlic Herb Butter
  * ¼ cup Parmesan Cheese
  * 2 teaspoon Olive Oil
  * 2 tablespoon Butter
  * Salt
  * Pepper
directions: >-
  1. Bring a medium pot of salted water to a boil. Wash and dry produce. • Trim
  and slice mushrooms into ¼-inch-thick pieces. Trim and thinly slice scallions,
  separating whites from greens.

  2. Heat a large drizzle of olive oil in a large pan over medium-high heat. Add mushrooms; season with salt and pepper. Cook, stirring occasionally, until browned and slightly crispy, 5-7 minutes. • Turn off heat; transfer to a paper-towel-lined plate. Wash out pan.

  3. Once water is boiling, add cavatappi to pot. Cook, stirring occasionally, until al dente, 9-11 minutes. • Reserve 1 cup pasta cooking water, then drain.

  4. While pasta cooks, melt 2 TBSP plain butter (4 TBSP for 4 servings) in pan used for mushrooms over medium-high heat. Add scallion whites and cook until just softened, 1 minute. • Add flour and cook, stirring constantly, until lightly browned, 1-2 minutes. • Whisk in milk and 1⁄3 cup reserved pasta cooking water (½ cup for 4), breaking up any flour clumps. Simmer until slightly thickened, 3-4 minutes.

  5. Stir cream cheese into pan with sauce until melted. • Stir in mushrooms, drained cavatappi, and garlic herb butter. Season with salt and pepper. TIP: If needed, stir in more reserved pasta cooking water a splash at a time until everything is coated in a creamy sauce.

  6. Divide pasta between bowls; sprinkle with Parmesan and scallion greens. Serve.
