ingredients: |-
  

  * 12 oz raspberries - fresh or frozen; about 3⅓ cups
  * 4 to 6 tablespoons granulated sugar - adjust to taste
  * 1 teaspoon lemon juice - or more
directions: >-
  

  * **Heat:** Add the raspberries, sugar, and lemon juice to a saucepan and bring to a boil while mashing the raspberries to break them down. Once it boils, turn off the heat and adjust with more sugar or lemon juice as needed.

    12 oz raspberries,4 to 6 tablespoons granulated sugar,1 teaspoon lemon juice
  * **Strain**: Strain the raspberry sauce through a fine mesh sieve to remove the seeds. Press firmly to extract all of the pulp as that is what thickens the sauce. If desired, thin with a teaspoon of water at a time, keeping in mind the sauce thickens as it cools (the sauce in the photo was not thinned). *See Note 1.*

  * **Serve:** Add to cheesecake, cakes, ice cream, or other desserts. Enjoy!


  ### ✎ RECIPE NOTES


  Makes approximately 1 cup of raspberry sauce. Store leftovers in the fridge in an airtight container for up to 4 days.


  1. **Straining**: Some recipes call for pureeing the sauce first, but I find that unnecessary, making it harder to strain the seeds out since they become smaller in size. However, you can puree the sauce if you prefer.
