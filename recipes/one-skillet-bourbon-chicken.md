directions: >-
  

  1. Combine soy sauce, bourbon, apple juice, vinegar, maple syrup, garlic, ginger and crushed red pepper in a small bowl.

  2. Toss together chicken and 1 tablespoon cornstarch in a large bowl. Heat oil in a large nonstick skillet over medium-high heat. Add the chicken; cook, stirring occasionally, until golden brown and crispy, 6 to 8 minutes. Add the soy-bourbon mixture; stir to coat. Cook, stirring often, until the sauce has reduced to a syrupy consistency and the chicken is cooked through, 6 to 8 minutes.

  3. Combine water and the remaining 1 teaspoon cornstarch in a small bowl; stir to mix well. Add to the pan; cook, stirring often, until the sauce thickens and coats the chicken, 1 to 2 minutes.

  4. Divide rice among 4 plates; top with the chicken and sauce. Garnish with scallions, if desired.
