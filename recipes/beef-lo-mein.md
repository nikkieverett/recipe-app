directions: >-
  1. Mix together all the ingredients listed under “LO MEIN SAUCE”\

  2. Thinly slice your beef and marinate with 2 TBSP of “LO MEIN SAUCE” and 2 tsp cornstarch. Marinate this for 10 mins and then sear.\

  3. For your veggies, heat up some oil (high heat) and sauté your carrots for 1 minute. Then add snow pea and sauté for another minute. Then add cabbage and sauté for another minute. Add mushrooms, sauté for 1 minute. Add scallion, sauté for 1 minute. I recommend sautéing the veggies in this order.\
