ingredients: |-
  * 2 large chicken breasts sliced in half lengthwise
  * Salt & pepper to taste
  * 1/4 teaspoon garlic powder
  * 1/2 teaspoon + 1 tablespoon Cajun seasoning (use a no or low salt variety)
  * Flour for dredging
  * 2 tablespoons butter
  * 1 tablespoon olive oil
  * 3 cloves garlic minced
  * 1/4 cup sun-dried tomatoes
  * 1/4 cup chicken broth
  * 1 cup heavy/whipping cream
  * 1/2 cup freshly grated parmesan cheese
  * Salt & pepper to taste
directions: >-
  1. Cut the chicken in half lengthwise so you have four thinner cutlets.
  Sprinkle them with salt & pepper, garlic powder, and 1/2 teaspoon of the Cajun
  seasoning. Coat them in flour.

  2. Add the butter and oil to a skillet over medium-high heat. Once the pan is hot, add the chicken. Cook it for 4-5 min/side or until it's nice and golden. Take the chicken out of the pan and set it aside.

  3. Add the minced garlic, sun-dried tomatoes, and chicken broth to the pan. Let it bubble for about 30 seconds or so.

  4. Reduce the heat to medium and stir in the cream and remaining 1 tablespoon of Cajun seasoning.

  5. Add the chicken back into the pan and cook for another 5 minutes or so, until the sauce is thickened a bit and the chicken is cooked through. Sprinkle the parmesan cheese over top (or stir it into the sauce). Season with salt & pepper as needed and serve immediately.
