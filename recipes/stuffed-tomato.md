  1. **Preheat the Oven** – Set the oven rack to the middle position. Preheat to 400ºF (200ºC). Lightly grease an 8×8-inch baking dish with olive oil. Alternatively, use a foil-lined baking sheet.

  2. C﻿ook Italian sausage in a skillet.

  3. **Wash** – Rinse the tomatoes under cool running water. Dry with a clean towel.

  4. **Prepare the Tomatoes** – Trim off about ¼ inch from the top of the tomato. Use a spoon to scoop out the pulpy seeds, then pour out the juices. Season the cavity with salt. Invert the tomatoes and place them on a paper towel-lined plate to drain the juices.

  5. **Make the Stuffing** – In a medium bowl, combine the bread crumbs, italian sausage, parmesan cheese, garlic, parsley, basil, salt, and pepper. Add 2 tablespoons of olive oil, mixing until the bread crumbs are evenly coated. 

  6. **Stuff Each Tomato** – Stuff each hollowed tomato with about ¼ cup of the filling, lightly packing it into a small mound. Do not overfill.

  7. **Bake** – Transfer to the greased baking sheet. Drizzle about ½ teaspoon of olive oil over the filling of each tomato. Bake until soft, the skin just begins to wrinkle, and the tops are golden brown and crispy, about 20 to 25 minutes.

  8. **Serve** – Transfer to a platter and serve immediately while still hot. If desired, garnish with chopped parsley.
