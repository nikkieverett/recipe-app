add 1 t. of the remaining butter to the pan and add the mushrooms. cook

 until mushrooms are golden brown around the edges and have given off their liquid. add the marsala wine and bring to a boil
 scraping to remove any browned bits from the bottom of the pan. when the wine has reduced by half add the chicken stock and cook for 3 minute or until sauce has thickened.
