  1. Whisk the egg custard:

     Whisk the eggs, half-and-half, mustard, salt, and pepper in a large bowl until smooth. Set aside.
  2. Assemble the casserole: 

     Lightly grease a 13x9-inch baking dish with cooking spray. 

     Place 1 slice of the ham, 1 slice of the turkey, and 1 slice of the Swiss cheese (folding ham, turkey, and cheese to fit, if needed) on the bottom half of each croissant. Cover with the top halves. Place the stuffed croissants in the baking dish.

     Pour the egg mixture over the croissants. Cover with aluminum foil, and chill for 8 hours or up to 12 hours.
  3. Bake:

     Preheat the oven to 350°F. Bake, covered, for 15 minutes. Uncover and continue to bake until the tops of the croissants are golden brown and the egg mixture is almost set, about 20 minutes. Let cool for 10 minutes.
  4. Make the drizzle, garnish, and serve:

     Stir the jam and maple syrup in a small bowl until smooth. Lightly dust the casserole with powdered sugar and drizzle with the raspberry jam sauce.
