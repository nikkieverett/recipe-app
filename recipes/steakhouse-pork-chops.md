ingredients: |-
  * 12 ounce Yukon Gold Potatoes
  * 1 unit Yellow Onion
  * 1 unit Lemon
  * 2 tablespoon Sour Cream
  * 12 ounce Pork Chops
  * 1 tablespoon Bold & Savory Steak Spice
  * 1 unit Beef Stock Concentrate
  * 6 ounce Green Beans
  * 2 teaspoon Olive Oil
  * Salt / Pepper
  * 2 teaspoon Cooking Oil
directions: >-
  1. Adjust rack to top position (top and middle positions for 4 servings) and
  preheat oven to 425 degrees. Wash and dry all produce. • Dice potatoes into
  ½-inch pieces. Halve and peel onion; mince one half (whole onion for 4). Zest
  and quarter lemon.

  2. Toss potatoes on one side of a baking sheet with a drizzle of oil, salt, and pepper. (For 4 servings, spread potatoes out across entire sheet; roast 20-25 minutes total.) • Roast on top rack for 10 minutes (you’ll add the green beans then).

  3. Once potatoes have roasted 10 minutes, remove sheet from oven. Carefully toss green beans on empty side with a drizzle of oil, salt, and pepper. (For 4 servings, leave potatoes roasting and add green beans to a second baking sheet; roast on middle rack.) • Return to top rack until potatoes are golden brown and green beans are tender, 10-15 minutes more.

  4. While veggies roast, pat pork* dry with paper towels; season all over with salt, then coat with as much Steak Spice as will stick. • Heat a drizzle of olive oil in a large pan over medium-high heat. Add pork and cook until browned and cooked through, 4-6 minutes per side. TIP: If crust begins to brown too quickly, reduce heat to medium. • Turn off heat; transfer pork to a plate. Wipe out pan.

  5. Heat another drizzle of olive oil in same pan over medium heat. Add minced onion; cook, stirring, until softened and lightly browned, 3-4 minutes. • Stir in stock concentrate and ¼ cup water (1⁄3 cup for 4 servings). Bring to a simmer and cook until reduced, 2-3 minutes. • Remove from heat and stir in sour cream. Season generously with pepper.

  6. Toss green beans with lemon zest. • Divide pork, potatoes, and green beans between plates. Spoon sauce over pork. Serve with lemon wedges on the side.
