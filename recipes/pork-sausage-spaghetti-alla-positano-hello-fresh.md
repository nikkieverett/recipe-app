  Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Once boiling, add spaghetti. Cook, stirring occasionally, until al dente, 9-11 minutes. Reserve ½ cup pasta cooking water (1 cup for 4 servings), then drain.


  2 Meanwhile, wash and dry all produce. Trim and halve zucchini lengthwise; cut crosswise into ¼-inchthick half-moons. Dice tomato; toss in a small bowl with a drizzle of olive oil and a pinch of salt and pepper. Thinly slice half the chili (if you like spicy food, slice the whole thing). Quarter lemon. Remove sausage from casing; discard casing.


  3 Heat a large drizzle of olive oil in a large pan over medium-high heat. Add zucchini in a single layer; season with salt and pepper. Cook, stirring occasionally, until browned and tender, 5-6 minutes. Transfer to a plate.


  4 Heat a drizzle of olive oil in same pan over medium-high heat. Add sausage and cook, breaking up meat into pieces, until browned and cooked through, 4-6 minutes. (TIP: If there’s excess grease in your pan, carefully pour it out.) Stir in tomato and a pinch of chili to taste. Cook until slightly softened, 1 minute.


  5 Add spaghetti, garlic herb butter, half the Parmesan (save the rest for serving), ¼ cup reserved pasta cooking water (⅓ cup for 4 servings), and 2 tsp lemon juice (1 TBSP for 4). Toss until thoroughly combined. (TIP: If needed, add more pasta cooking water a splash at a time until pasta is coated in sauce.) Stir in half the zucchini and season with plenty of salt and pepper.


  6 Divide pasta between bowls. Top with remaining zucchini and Parmesan. Garnish with a pinch of remaining chili if desired. Serve with remaining lemon wedges on the side.
