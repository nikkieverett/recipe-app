  * 1 cup hot water
directions: >-
  1. In a bowl, combine the flour, baking powder, and salt. Add the butter, then
  pour over the hot water. Stir until a shaggy dough begins to form.

  2. Turn the dough out onto a floured counter. Use your hands to knead the dough for 1-2 minutes until it forms a smooth ball. Cover the bowl with a damp towel and let rest 10 minutes.

  3. Cut the dough into 12-14 equal wedges, then roll each wedge into a ball (they don't need to be perfect). Use a rolling pin or a tortilla press to roll the dough out into an 8 – inch circle.

  4. Heat a skillet over medium-high heat. Add a small drizzle of olive oil, then a tortilla. Cook 30-60 seconds, until little bubbles appear on the surface. Flip and cook another 30 seconds, or until the bottom is slightly golden. Set on a plate and cover with a towel. Repeat with the remaining dough.

  5. Serve warm (yum!) or save for later. Keep the tortillas stored in an airtight container for up to 3 days.
