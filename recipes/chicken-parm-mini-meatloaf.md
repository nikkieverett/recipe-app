directions: >-
  For the breadcrumbs:

  * The following day; crumble the toasted wheat bread to the consistency of pebbles and sand in a small bowl and set aside


  For the potato base:

  * Preheat the oven to 350 degrees f

  * Dunk each piece of potato in the butter and pat dry a little

  * Line the bottoms and all the way up the sides of 6 cups of a 12-cup muffin tin with 2 to 3 layers of potato slices (about 15 slices per muffin cup

  * so that the potatoes come up about 1/4 inch over the top)

  * Fill the empty cups with water

  * Bake until the potatoes are golden (about 25 minutes)

  * Set aside


  For the chicken meatloaf:

  * Raise the oven temperature to 375 degrees f

  * In a large bowl, add the lemonade and reserved breadcrumbs and stir until mushy

  * Add the parmesan, onion, worcestershire, salt, chile flakes, garlic, egg and a few grinds of black pepper

  * Stir until it forms a loose paste

  * Add the chicken and tomatoes and fold with your hands until everything is combined (this should be sticky)

  * Press some of the chicken mixture into each potato-lined muffin cup

  * Press a sprig of thyme on top of each

  * Refill each empty cup with water

  * Bake until the meatloaf edges are golden brown (about 15 minutes)

  * Allow to cool slightly for 5 minutes

  * Then remove each loaf with a spatula or butter knife

  * Serve with meatloaf gravy if desired


  Meatloaf gravy:

  * In a small pot on medium heat add the butter and flour

  * Cook, stirring constantly, until the mixture stops foaming and deepens a bit to a light golden color

  * Add the worcestershire and garlic and whisk to combine

  * Add the thyme

  * Then whisk while slowly pouring in the stock and lemonade

  * Whisk until reduced and thickened to gravy consistency (about 5 minutes)
