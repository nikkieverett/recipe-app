  ### Instructions


  * Preheat your air fryer to 400 degrees or oven to 420.

  * Core the cauliflower and cut into larger florets.

  * Beat the eggs together in a small bowl.

  * In a separate bowl, combine the almond flour, Parmesan, garlic powder, smoked paprika, salt and pepper.

  * Dip the cauliflower into the egg mixture, and then coat in the almond flour mixture.

  * Transfer to a parchment lined baking sheet until ready to cook.

  * Continue with the remaining cauliflower.

  * Spray the bottom of your air fryer or parchment lined baking sheet with oil.

  * Add the cauliflower in a single layer. Spray the top.

  * Cook for 10 to 12 minutes in the air fryer or 20 to 22 minutes in the oven, until golden brown, flipping half way through.


  #### Sauce


  * While the cauliflower is cooking, make the sauce by combining the Franks Hot Sauce and butter in a small saucepan.

  * Heat over medium low heat until the butter melts.


  #### To Combine


  * Toss the crispy cauliflower with the sauce, and serve using a slotted spoon.

notes: >-
  * I use sweet baby ray's buffalo sauce instead of making mine from scratch.

  * While doing the breading, try to stick with one hand for the egg mixture, and the other for the almond flour mixture. This will make it easier, and less messy! When you use the same hand for both, the flour mixture tends to clump on your fingers and stick to it.

  * Keep your breadcrumbs in a seperate bowl than the one that you do the mixing to keep it from getting soggy. Add only as much as you need for each peice.
