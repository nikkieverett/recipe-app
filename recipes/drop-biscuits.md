href: https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1019276-drop-biscuit
ingredients: >-
  * 2 cups/255 grams all-purpose flour

  * 1 tablespoon baking powder

  * 1/2 teaspoon kosher salt

  * 1 teaspoon granulated sugar

  * 10 tablespoons/141 grams cold (put in freezer) unsalted butter, cut into cubes (*I grated it)

  * ¾ cup whole milk, plus 1 to 2 tablespoons, if needed
directions: >-
  1. Heat the oven to 400 degrees. Line a rimmed baking sheet with parchment
  paper. 

  2. In a large bowl, whisk together flour, baking powder, salt and sugar. 

  3. Using a pastry blender or two knives, cut the butter into the flour mixture until it is the texture of coarse meal with some pea-size pieces. (I just use my hands)

  4. Using a fork, stir in the milk until just evenly moistened, adding up to 2 more tablespoons, if necessary, but stopping before the dough gets too wet. 

  5. Scoop the dough into 8 rough mounds (about 1/3-cup each) and place them on the prepared sheets. 

  6. Bake the biscuits until golden brown and a toothpick inserted into the center comes out with moist crumbs attached, about 20 minutes. Serve warm or at room temperature.
