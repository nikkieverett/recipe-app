  * While waiting for the water to boil: Mix Sauce in small bowl.  

  * Heat 2 tbsp oil in a large non stick pan (or well seasoned skillet) over high heat. Add garlic and onion, cook for 30 seconds.

  * Add chicken and cook for 1 1/2 minutes until mostly cooked through.

  * Push to one side of the pan, pour egg in on the other side. Scramble using the wooden spoon (add touch of extra oil if pan is too dry), then mix into chicken.

  * Add bean sprouts, tofu, noodles then Sauce.

  * Toss gently for about 1 1/2 minutes until Sauce is absorbed by the noodles.

  * Add garlic chives and half the peanuts. Toss through quickly then remove from heat.

  * Serve immediately, sprinkled with remaining peanuts and lime wedges on the side, with a sprinkle of chilli and a handful of extra beansprouts on the side if desired (this is the Thai way!). Squeeze over lime juice to taste before eating.

notes: >-
  **1.Tamarind** is the heart and soul of Pad Thai. The authentic version starts
  with tamarind pulp which needs to be soaked then strained. Puree is sold in a
  jar at supermarkets (Asian section), far easier! It’s a scoopable soft paste
  (see video).It can be labelled as Tamarind Puree or Paste (not to be confused
  with Tamarind concentrate which is stronger – use about 1/3 of the amount if
  you have this).


  **KETCHUP SUBSTITUTE** if you can’t find tamarind. Use this for the Pad Thai Sauce instead of ingredients listed above:1 tbsp ketchup, 2 tbsp brown sugar, 2 tbsp fish sauce, 2 tsp oyster sauce, 1 tsp dark soy sauce\*, 2 tbsp rice vinegar (or 1 tbsp white vinegar).See in post for explanation, and cynics, don’t judge until you’ve tried this! It’s remarkably good and quite close to the base Pad Thai recipe!: \* This is mainly for colour, so can be substituted with light or normal soy sauce and flavour will still be the same.


  **2.Fish sauce** Can be substituted with light soy sauce though you will lose a bit of the flavour edge that fish sauce gives it. 


  **3.Oyster sauce**. Not in authentic Pad Thai but is essential for this everyday version. 


  **4.Garlic** chives look like blades of grass and taste like garlicky chives. If you can’t find them, it’s not a deal killer. Best to substitute with chopped green onion / scallions.
