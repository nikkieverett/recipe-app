href: https://www.hellofresh.com/recipes/tuscan-spiced-chicken-cheesy-broccoli-627a6f7bc54c4790410edb84
ingredients: |-
  * 9 ounce Carrots
  * 8 ounce Broccoli Florets
  * 1 unit Roma Tomato
  * 1 clove Garlic
  * 10 ounce Chicken Cutlets
  * 1 tablespoon Tuscan Heat Spice
  * 2 tablespoon Cream Cheese
  * 1 unit Mushroom Stock Concentrate
  * ¼ cup Monterey Jack Cheese
directions: >-
  1. Adjust rack to top position (top and middle for 4 servings) and preheat
  oven to 425 degrees. Wash and dry produce. • Trim, peel, and cut carrots on a
  diagonal into 1⁄2-inch-thick pieces. Cut broccoli florets into bite-size
  pieces if necessary. Peel and mince or grate garlic. Dice tomato into 1⁄4-inch
  pieces.

  2. Toss carrots on one side of a baking sheet with a drizzle of olive oil, salt, and pepper. Roast on top rack for 5 minutes (you’ll add the broccoli then).

  3. Once carrots have roasted 5 minutes, remove baking sheet from oven. Carefully toss broccoli on empty side with a large drizzle of olive oil, salt, and pepper. (For 4, toss broccoli on a second baking sheet; roast broccoli on top rack and carrots on middle rack.) • Return sheet to top rack and roast until veggies are browned and tender, 15-20 minutes.

  4.  Meanwhile, pat chicken* dry with paper towels and season all over with 1⁄2 tsp Tuscan Heat Spice (1 tsp for 4 servings), salt, and pepper. • Heat a drizzle of oil in a large pan over medium-high heat. Add chicken and cook until browned and cooked through, 3-5 minutes per side. (TIP: if chicken starts to brown too quickly, reduce heat to medium and add a splash or two of water.) • Turn off heat; transfer to a cutting board to rest. Wipe out pan.

  5. Heat a drizzle of oil in same pan over medium-high heat. Add garlic and tomato. Cook, stirring, until fragrant and softened, 30-60 seconds. • Stir in cream cheese, stock concentrate, half the Monterey Jack, 1⁄2 cup water (1 cup for 4 servings), and a pinch of Tuscan Heat Spice (we used 1⁄4 tsp; about 1⁄3 tsp for 4) until melted and combined. Cook, stirring occasionally, until sauce has thickened, 1-3 minutes. • Remove pan from heat and stir in 1 TBSP butter (2 TBSP for 4) until melted. Season with salt and pepper.

  6.  When veggies are almost done, remove sheet from oven. Carefully push broccoli into two bunches on sheet and sprinkle with remaining Monterey Jack (for 4 servings, remove sheet with broccoli from oven and carefully push broccoli into four bunches). Return to top rack and roast until cheese melts, 2-3 minutes. • Slice chicken crosswise. • Divide chicken, broccoli, and carrots between plates. Spoon sauce over chicken and serve.
