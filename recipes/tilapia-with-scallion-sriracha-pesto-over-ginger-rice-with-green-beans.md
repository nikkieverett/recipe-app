ingredients: |-
  * 1 thumb Ginger
  * 4 unit Scallions
  * 1 unit Lemon
  * ½ cup Jasmine Rice
  * 1 tablespoon Sesame Oil
  * 1 tablespoon Sesame Seeds
  * 1 teaspoon Sriracha
  * 11 ounce Tilapia
  * 6 ounce Green Beans
  * 2 tablespoon Soy Sauce
  * 1 teaspoon Sugar
  * 1 tablespoon Butter
  * 1 tablespoon Olive Oil
  * 1 tablespoon Cooking Oil
  * Salt
  * Pepper
directions: >-
  1. Wash and dry produce (except green beans). • Peel and mince or grate
  ginger. Trim and finely chop scallions. Halve lemon; cut one half into wedges
  (for 4 servings, halve one lemon and quarter remaining).

  2. Heat a drizzle of oil in a small pot over medium-high heat. Add 1 TBSP ginger (2 TBSP for 4 servings). Cook, stirring, until fragrant, 30 seconds. • Add ¾ cup water (1½ cups for 4) and a pinch of salt. Bring to a boil, then stir in rice. Cover and reduce to a low simmer. Cook until rice is tender, 15-18 minutes. Keep covered off heat until ready to serve.

  3. While rice cooks, in a medium bowl, combine scallions, sesame oil, half the sesame seeds, 1 TBSP olive oil, 1 tsp ginger, 1 tsp sugar, juice from lemon half, and Sriracha to taste. (For 4 servings, use all sesame seeds, 2 TBSP olive oil, 2 tsp ginger, 2 tsp sugar, and juice from both lemon halves.) Season with salt and pepper; add more ginger or lemon juice to taste.

  4. Pat tilapia* dry with paper towels; season generously all over with salt and pepper. • Heat a large drizzle of oil in a large, preferably nonstick, pan over medium- high heat. Add tilapia and cook until browned and cooked through, 4-6 minutes per side. Turn off heat.

  5. While tilapia cooks, pierce green bean bag with a fork; place bag on a plate. Microwave until tender, 1-2 minutes. TIP: No microwave? No problem! Steam green beans in a small pot with a splash of water until just tender, 5-7 minutes. • Transfer green beans to a second medium bowl; add 1 TBSP butter (2 TBSP for 4 servings). Toss until melted. Season with salt and pepper.

  6. Fluff rice with a fork and season with salt and pepper. • Divide rice and green beans between plates. Arrange tilapia over rice; drizzle with scallion Sriracha pesto and soy sauce to taste. Serve with lemon wedges on the side.
