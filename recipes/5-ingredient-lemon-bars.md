title: 5 ingredient lemon bars
ingredients: |-
  shortbread crust ingredients
  * 1 1/2 cups all-purpose flour
  * 3/4 cup cold butter diced
  * 1/4 cup powdered sugar
  * zest of 1 lemon
  * lemon filling ingredients
  * 4 large eggs
  * 1 cup powdered sugar
  * 1/2 cup freshly-squeezed lemon juice
  * 2 tablespoons all-purpose flour
directions: >-
  1. Preheat oven to 350°f

  2. Line an 8 x 8-inch baking pan with parchment paper; set aside

  3. Combine all of the crust ingredients in a food processor

  4. Pulse until the mixture reaches a fine crumble consistency

  5. You want the butter to be well combined but to stop before the mixture turns into a ball (alternately you can combine the crust ingredients together in a mixing bowl with a pastry cutter or a fork)

  6. Sprinkle the crust mixture evenly into the prepared pan

  7. Then press the mixture down firmly to form an even layer

  8. Bake the crust for 20 minutes or until it is lightly golden on top

  9. Meanwhile whisk the lemon filling ingredients together in a medium mixing bowl until combined.

  10. If your powdered sugar or flour are too chunky or there are lots of bubbles whisked into the filling feel free to just pour the filling through a fine-mesh strainer to get it nice and smooth before adding it to the crust (but if there are a few little clumps that’s ok too!)

  12. Once the crust is done baking remove the pan from the oven and immediately pour the lemon filling on top of the hot crust

  13. Return the pan to the oven and bake for 18-20 more minutes, or until the lemon filling has set

  14. Remove the pan from the oven and transfer to a wire baking rack to cool until the bars reach room temperature

  15. Then transfer to the refrigerator and let the bars chill for at least 2 hours

  16. Sprinkle the tops of the bars with extra powdered sugar if you would like, then slice and serve
