title: 5 ingredient lemon bars
ingredients: |-
  _Shortbread crust ingredients:_
  * 1 1/2 cups all-purpose flour
  * 3/4 cup cold butter diced
  * 1/4 cup powdered sugar
  * zest of 1 lemon
  * lemon filling ingredients
  * 4 large eggs
  * 1 cup powdered sugar
  * 1/2 cup freshly-squeezed lemon juice
  * 2 tablespoons all-purpose flour
directions: |-
  * Preheat oven to 350°f
  * Line an 8 x 8-inch baking pan with parchment paper; set aside
  * Combine all of the crust ingredients in a food processor
  * Pulse until the mixture reaches a fine crumble consistency
  * You want the butter to be well combined but to stop before the mixture turns into a ball (alternately you can combine the crust ingredients together in a mixing bowl with a pastry cutter or a fork)
  * Sprinkle the crust mixture evenly into the prepared pan
  * Then press the mixture down firmly to form an even layer
  * Bake the crust for 20 minutes or until it is lightly golden on top
  * Meanwhile whisk the lemon filling ingredients together in a medium mixing bowl until combined.
  * If your powdered sugar or flour are too chunky or there are lots of bubbles whisked into the filling feel free to just pour the filling through a fine-mesh strainer to get it nice and smooth before adding it to the crust (but if there are a few little clumps that’s ok too!)
  * Once the crust is done baking remove the pan from the oven and immediately pour the lemon filling on top of the hot crust
  * Return the pan to the oven and bake for 18-20 more minutes, or until the lemon filling has set
  * Remove the pan from the oven and transfer to a wire baking rack to cool until the bars reach room temperature
  * Then transfer to the refrigerator and let the bars chill for at least 2 hours
  * Sprinkle the tops of the bars with extra powdered sugar if you would like, then slice and serve

notes: |-
  * Very tart!
  * If baking these bars in an 9 x 9-inch baking dish, cooking time will be a few minutes less.
  * If you would like to add on decorative lemon slices, I recommend adding them just before serving since the lemon juice soaks out fairly quickly into the powdered sugar topping
  * To minimize the juiciness of the lemons, I blotted my lemon slices briefly on a paper towel before adding them to the bars
