directions: >-
  1. •Adjust racks to middle and top positions and preheat oven to 425 degrees.
  Wash and dry produce. • Peel and mince or grate ginger. Trim and thinly slice
  scallions, separating whites from greens; mince whites. 

  2. Trim and peel carrots on a diagonal into 1/2inch pieces. Toss on a baking sheet with a drizzle of oil and a pinch of salt and pepper.

  3. R﻿oast on top rack until browned and tender 20-25 minutes


  ![Cook Rice](<>)


  1. Heat a drizzle of oil in a small pot over medium-high heat. Add half the ginger; cook until fragrant, 1 minute. • Stir in rice, 1¼ cups water (2¼ cups for 4 servings), and a pinch of salt. Bring to a boil, then cover and reduce heat to low. Cook until rice is tender, 15-18 minutes. • Keep covered off heat until ready to serve.


  ![Form & Bake Meatballs](<>)


  1. While rice cooks, in a large bowl, combine beef*, scallion whites, panko, remaining ginger, and 1 TBSP bulgogi sauce (2 TBSP for 4 servings). (You’ll use the rest of the bulgogi sauce later.) Season with salt (we used ¾ tsp; 1½ tsp for 4) and pepper. • Form into 1½-inch meatballs; place on a baking sheet. • Bake meatballs on middle rack until browned and cooked through, 14-16 minutes.


  ![Make Crema & Coat](<>)


  1. Meanwhile, in a small bowl, combine sour cream with Sriracha to taste. Add water 1 tsp at a time until mixture reaches a drizzling consistency. • Once meatballs are done, carefully transfer to a second large bowl; add remaining bulgogi sauce and toss to coat.


  ![Finish & Serve](<>)


  1. Fluff rice with a fork; taste and season with salt if desired. • Divide rice between plates and top with green beans, meatballs, and any bulgogi sauce from bowl. Drizzle with Sriracha crema. Garnish with scallion greens and as many sesame seeds as you like. Serve.
