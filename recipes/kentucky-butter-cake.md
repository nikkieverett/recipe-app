  * 1 1/2 tsp. vanilla extract
directions: >-
  1. ### Combine dry ingredients and wet ingredients:

     Preheat oven to 325°F. In a medium bowl, sift together all-purpose flour, salt, baking powder, and baking soda. Set aside.

     Stir together the buttermilk and vanilla extract in a liquid measuring cup and set aside.
  2. ### Cream butter and sugar:

     Using a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment, beat butter and granulated sugar on a medium-high speed until light and airy, about 3-5 minutes.
  3. ### Add eggs:

     Add eggs to the butter mixture one at a time, beating until incorporated. Scrape down the bottom and sides of the bowl often.
  4. ### Make cake batter:

     Alternate adding the flour mixture and buttermilk mixture in thirds.

     Mix until thoroughly combined, scraping down the bottom and sides of the bowl as needed.
  5. ### Add batter to prepared pan:

     Generously coat a 10-inch Bundt pan with baking spray.

     Transfer batter to the prepared Bundt pan.
  6. ### Bake cake:

     Bake for 60-70 minutes until a wooden pick inserted into the center comes out clean.
  7. ### While the cake bakes, prepare the glaze.

     Combine sugar, butter, and water in a saucepan and heat until the sugar has dissolved, making sure not to let the glaze boil.

     Stir in vanilla.
  8. ### Poke holes in cake:

     When cake has finished baking, remove from oven and place on a cooling rack. Using a large skewer, immediately poke deep holes all over the cake without removing from pan.
  9. ### Glaze the cake:

     Slowly pour half of the glaze (about 3/4 cup) over the top of the cake, giving the cake time to absorb before adding more glaze. Allow the cake to rest for 10 minutes to allow the glaze to absorb fully

     Be sure not to let it sit in the pan longer than 10 minutes, or the glaze could cause the cake to stick inside the pan.
  10. ### Flip cake out of pan:

      Loosen the sides of the cake, then invert the cake onto a plate or serving platter. Warm the remaining glaze up slightly, then slowly pour over the top of the cake.
  11. ### Let cool:

      Allow the cake to cool completely before serving.
