servings: 6 cups of soup
notes:
directions: |-
  * Whisk together stock (chilled or room-temperature), cornstarch, ginger and garlic powder in a medium sauce pan until smooth
  * Heat over high heat until the stock comes to a simmer, stirring occasionally
  * Meanwhile, whisk together the eggs and egg whites in a small measuring cup or bowl (i find the measuring cup easier for pouring)
  * Once the broth reaches a simmer, use a fork or a whisk to stir the broth in a circular motion, creating a “whirlpool” then slowly pour the whisked eggs into the soup as you continue stirring, in order to create long egg ribbons
  * Remove pan from heat
  * Stir in the sesame oil, green onions and corn (optional) until combined
  * Season with salt and pepper to taste, also adding a dash or two of more sesame oil if needed
  * Serve immediately, sprinkled with additional green onions
