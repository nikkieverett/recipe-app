servings: 6 cups of soup
notes:
directions: 'whisk together stock (chilled or room-temperature)
 cornstarch
 ginger and garlic powder in a medium sauce pan until smooth. heat over high heat until the stock comes to a simmer
 stirring occasionally.
meanwhile
 whisk together the eggs and egg whites in a small measuring cup or bowl. (i find the measuring cup easier for pouring.)
once the broth reaches a simmer
 use a fork or a whisk to stir the broth in a circular motion
 creating a “whirlpool.” then slowly pour the whisked eggs into the soup as you continue stirring
 in order to create long egg ribbons.
remove pan from heat.  stir in the sesame oil
 green onions and corn (optional) until combined.  season with salt and pepper to taste
 also adding a dash or two of more sesame oil if needed.
serve immediately
 sprinkled with additional green onions.
