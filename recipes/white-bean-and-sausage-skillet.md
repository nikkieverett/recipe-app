  2. Add 3 minced garlic cloves to the pan and cook until fragrant, about 30 seconds. Add 1 (about 15-ounce) can white beans (do not drain) and use a potato masher or fork to mash about half of the beans. Stir in the remaining 1 can white beans (do not drain), 1/2 cup low-sodium chicken broth, 2 teaspoons dried Italian seasoning, 1/2 teaspoon black pepper, and 1/4 teaspoon kosher salt. Bring to a simmer and cook until thickened and reduced slightly, 3 to 5 minutes.

  3. Stir in 1/2 bunch coarsely chopped kale leaves and 2 ounces finely grated Parmesan cheese until the kale is wilted and the cheese is melted, about 1 minute.

  4. Stir in 1 tablespoon lemon juice. Ladle into bowls and serve with more Parmesan cheese if desired.
