Place the turkey in a pan on top of the vegetables. In a small bowl combine salt, pepper, and paprika. Season the cavity of the turkey with one-third of the salt mixture. Fold wing tips under turkey. 


  2. Melt butter in a small saucepan over medium about 2 minutes or until edges begin to turn golden. Add sage and thyme; cook and stir for 1 minute. Using a slotted spoon, transfer sage and thyme to the cavity of the turkey. Tie turkey legs together using 100%-cotton kitchen string. Brush butter over the outside of the turkey. Sprinkle the remaining salt mixture over the turkey.


  3. Roast turkey in oven bag according to oven bag directions. Tent turkey with foil and let stand 10 to 15 minutes before carving. If you like, serve turkey on a platter and garnish with fresh sage leaves and halved or quartered oranges. Serve with Turkey Gravy.

Remove from heat and stir in 1 tsp. fresh thyme leaves. Season to taste with kosher salt and pepper. Serve immediately with turkey.
