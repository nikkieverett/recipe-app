  * 2 teaspoons ground cinnamon
directions: >-
  

  * Preheat the oven to 350°F. Lightly spray a standard 12-cup muffin tin with nonstick cooking spray. Set it aside.

  * Working on a lightly floured surface, roll out each tube of dough into a 12×16-inch rectangle. If using perforated crescent roll dough, be sure to pinch the seams to seal them.

  * Spread ½ cup of apple butter evenly over the top of each sheet of dough.

  * Starting on the long end of the dough sheet, tightly roll it up into a log.

  * Cut the log in half, creating two shorter logs.

  * Cut each of those shorter logs in half lengthwise, giving you four sections of dough.

  * Repeat these steps with the remaining two sheets of dough, resulting in 12 sections of dough.

  * Working with one section of dough at a time, with the layered side facing up, roll it tightly into a cinnamon roll shape, tucking in the end piece of dough.

  * Place each roll into the prepared muffin tin.

  * Bake for 22-24 minutes or until the cruffins are golden brown.


  #### Topping


  * In a small bowl, whisk together the sugar and cinnamon.

  * Remove rolls from the oven and immediately roll each cruffin in the cinnamon sugar mixture. Enjoy!
