  1. Gather the ingredients.

  2. Preheat the oven to 325 F. Heat a kettle or pot of water for the water bath. Pour 1 cup of the sugar into a warm pan over medium heat.

  3. Constantly stir the sugar while it heats until it browns and turns into [caramel](https://www.thespruceeats.com/homemade-caramel-sauce-recipe-1945750). Do not overcook since the caramel will burn and have a sour taste.

  4. Immediately, and working fast but carefully, pour approximately 2 to 3 tablespoons of caramel into each one of the 12 individual ramekins, tilting them so the caramel swirls around on the inside. As the caramel cools off, it will harden, so speed is essential for this step. If working with a big pan, add the caramel and cover the bottom and sides. Reheat the caramel in the pan if it thickens before you're done filling the ramekins.

  5. Using a hand whisk or an electric mixer, whisk all of the eggs. Add the condensed milk and evaporated milk, and mix well to incorporate.

  6. Slowly mix in the remaining 1/2 cup of sugar, beating well. Add the vanilla and mix thoroughly to make a silky mixture.

  7. Pour the custard mixture into the caramel-lined dishes, distributing it equally. Place the individual dishes in a large ceramic or metal baking pan with tall sides. Carefully pour hot water from the kettle into the baking pan around the custard dishes to a depth of about 2 inches.

  8. Cover the pan with foil and bake the flan from 1 hour to 1 hour and 15 minutes. After 1 hour, check with a knife inserted just off-center into one of the servings: If the knife comes out clean, the flan is ready. If not, leave it in the oven for 15 more minutes. If baking a whole flan, thump the side of the dish after 1 hour, and if it wobbles as one, the flan is ready. If it's wavy, it's not done yet and needs another 20 minutes. If done, carefully take the flan dish or dishes out of the hot water.

  9. Let the flans cool to room temperature, then place in the refrigerator for at least an hour before serving. Leave flan in the dishes they were baked in until it's time to serve. To serve, run a knife around the edge of the dish and invert each individual dish onto a small plate, allowing the flan to drop out and the caramel sauce to flow over the custard.
