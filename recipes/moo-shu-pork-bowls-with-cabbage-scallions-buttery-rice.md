ingredients: |-
  * 2 unit Scallions
  * 1 unit Lime
  * 10 ounce Ground Pork
  * 4 ounce Shredded Red Cabbage
  * 4 tablespoon Sweet Soy Glaze
  * 2 tablespoon Hoisin Sauce
  * 1 ounce Sweet Thai Chili Sauce
  * ½ cup Jasmine Rice
  * 1 tablespoon Sesame Seeds

directions: >-
  1. Wash and dry produce. • In a small pot, combine rice, ¾ cup water (1½ cups
  for 4 servings), and a pinch of salt. Bring to a boil, then reduce heat to
  low. Cook until rice is tender, 15-18 minutes. Keep covered off heat until
  ready to serve. • Thinly slice scallions, separating whites from greens.
  Quarter lime.

  2. Heat a drizzle of oil in a large pan over medium-high heat. Add pork* and cook, breaking up meat into pieces, until browned and cooked through, 4-6 minutes. TIP: If there’s excess grease in your pan, carefully pour it out.

  3. Stir scallion whites and cabbage into pan with pork; cook, stirring occasionally, until just tender, 2-3 minutes. • Stir in hoisin, chili sauce, 2½ TBSP sweet soy glaze (5 TBSP for 4 servings), and ½ tsp sugar (1 tsp for 4) until thoroughly combined. Turn off heat. • Taste and season with juice from half the lime (whole lime for 4), salt, and pepper.

  4. Fluff rice with a fork and stir in 1 TBSP butter (2 TBSP for 4 servings) until melted. Season with salt and pepper. • Divide rice between bowls and top with moo shu pork. Sprinkle with scallion greens and as many sesame seeds as you like. Serve with any remaining lime wedges on the side.
