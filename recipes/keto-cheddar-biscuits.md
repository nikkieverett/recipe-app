ingredients: |-
  * 1 ½ cups superfine almond flour
  * ¼ tsp salt
  * 1 tbsp baking powder
  * ½ tsp garlic powder
  * ½ tsp onion powder
  * 2 large eggs
  * 1/2 cup sour cream (see notes)
  * 4 tbsp unsalted butter (melted)
  * 1/2 cup shredded cheddar cheese
directions: >-
  * Preheat oven to 450°F. Lightly grease muffin cavities of a 12-cup muffin
  pan.

  * In a large bowl, whisk together almond flour, salt, baking powder, garlic powder and onion powder.

  * In a small bowl, combine eggs, sour cream, butter. Whisk until smooth. Pour into a large bowl with dry ingredients.

  * Mix with a whisk or spoon until batter is evenly mixed. It will be quite thick. Stir in cheese.

  * Scoop ¼ cup of batter and place into muffin mold. The batter is sticky so you will likely need to use a spatula to scrape and remove all the batter from the measuring cup. Repeat until all batter is used up

  * Bake biscuits about 10-11 minutes or until tops are golden and toothpick inserted comes out clean.

  * Allow biscuits to cool slightly before eating.
