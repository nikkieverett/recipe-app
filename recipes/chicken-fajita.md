directions: |-
  To brine your chicken breasts:
  * Fill a large bowl with 1 quart of warm water and 1/4 cup kosher salt
  * Stir to combine until most of the salt is absorbed
  * Add the chicken breasts and let them sit in the mixture to brine for 15 minutes, or you can also also cover the bowl and refrigerate for up to 6 hours
  * Remove the chicken breasts from the brine
  * Rinse them with cold water then pat them dry with some paper towels

  Once chicken is brined:
  * In a large bowl combine 2 tablespoons oil, lemon juice and seasonings
  * Add the chicken, turn to coat; cover
  * Refrigerate for 1-4 hours

  Once chicken is marinated:
  * Preheat oven to 450Â°f.
  * Place the chicken breasts in a single layer in a large baking dish or roasting pan
  * Bake for 15-18* minutes, or until the chicken is cooked through and no longer pink
  * If you want the chicken to be a little bit browned and crispier on top, you can turn the broiler on high for the final 3-5 minutes and broil the chicken until it is cooked through and golden on top (keep a close eye on the chicken so that it does not overcook and/or burn.)

  Once the chicken is cooked:
  * Remove the pan from the oven
  * Transfer the chicken to a clean plate
  * Loosely tent the plate with aluminum foil
  * Let the chicken rest for at least 5-10 minutes
