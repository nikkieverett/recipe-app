directions: 'to brine your chicken breasts
 fill a large bowl with 1 quart of warm water and 1/4 cup kosher salt. stir to combine until most of the salt is absorbed. add the chicken breasts and let them sit in the mixture to brine for 15 minutes. or you can also also cover the bowl and refrigerate for up to 6 hours. remove the chicken breasts from the brine
 rinse them with cold water
 then pat them dry with some paper towels. (however
 if the chicken breasts you purchased have already been pre-brined in a sodium solution
 skip this step.)
in a large bowl
 combine 2 tablespoons oil
 lemon juice and seasonings; add the chicken. turn to coat; cover. refrigerate for 1-4 hours.
preheat oven to 450°f.
place the chicken breasts in a single layer in a large baking dish or roasting pan.
bake for 15-18* minutes
 or until the chicken is cooked through and no longer pink. i recommend using a cooking thermometer to know exactly when it is fully cooked; in the thickest part of the breast
 it should be 165°f. (or
 if you want the chicken to be a little bit browned and crispier on top
 you can turn the broiler on high for the final 3-5 minutes and broil the chicken until it is cooked through and golden on top. keep a close eye on the chicken so that it does not overcook and/or burn.)
once the chicken is cooked
 remove the pan from the oven
 transfer the chicken to a clean plate
 and loosely tent the plate with aluminum foil. let the chicken rest for at least 5-10 minutes.'
