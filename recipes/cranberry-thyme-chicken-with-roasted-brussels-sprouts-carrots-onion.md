href: https://www.hellofresh.com/recipes/cranberry-thyme-chicken-6345a84d047ec2823e07e1e6
ingredients: |-
  * 8 ounce Brussels Sprouts
  * 1 unit Red Onion
  * 6 ounce Carrots
  * 1 unit Lemon
  * 10 ounce Chicken Cutlets
  * 1 teaspoon Dried Thyme
  * 1 tablespoon Fry Seasoning
  * 1 unit Chicken Stock Concentrate
  * 1 unit Cranberry Jam
  * 2 teaspoon Olive Oil
  * 1 teaspoon Cooking Oil
  * ¼ teaspoon Sugar
  * 1 tablespoon Butter
directions: >-
  1. Adjust rack to top position and preheat oven to 425 degrees. Wash and dry
  produce. • Trim and halve Brussels sprouts lengthwise. Halve, peel, and cut
  onion into ½-inch-thick wedges. Trim, peel, and cut carrots on a diagonal into
  ½-inch-thick pieces. Quarter lemon.

  2. Toss Brussels sprouts, onion, and carrots on a baking sheet with a large drizzle of olive oil, salt, and pepper. • Roast on top rack until golden brown and tender, 20-22 minutes.

  3. Meanwhile, pat chicken* dry with paper towels and season all over with Fry Seasoning, ¼ tsp thyme (½ tsp for 4 servings), salt, and pepper. (You’ll use more thyme later.)

  4. Heat a drizzle of oil in a large pan over medium heat. Add chicken and cook until browned and cooked through, 6-8 minutes per side. TIP: If chicken is on the thicker side, reduce heat to low; cook 2-3 minutes more per side. • Turn off heat; transfer chicken to a cutting board to rest. Wash out pan; let cool 1 minute.

  5. Return pan to medium-high heat; add stock concentrate, jam, ¼ cup water, ¼ tsp thyme, and ¼ tsp sugar (for 4 servings, use ½ cup water, ½ tsp thyme, and ½ tsp sugar). Cook, stirring occasionally, until sauce has thickened, 2-3 minutes. Turn off heat. • Stir in 1 TBSP butter (2 TBSP for 4) and juice from one lemon wedge (juice from two wedges for 4). (TIP: Add another squeeze of lemon juice if desired.) Season with salt and pepper to taste.

  6. Slice chicken crosswise. • Divide chicken and veggies between plates. Drizzle chicken with as much pan sauce as you like. Serve with remaining lemon wedges on the side.
