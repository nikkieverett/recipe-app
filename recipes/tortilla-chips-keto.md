  1. Preheat the oven to 350F. Line a baking sheet with parchment paper.

  2. In a large mixing bowl, add your almond flour and set aside. In a microwave safe bowl, add your mozzarella cheese and microwave for 1-2 minutes, until melted.

  3. Transfer your melted cheese into the bowl of almond flour and mix very well, until a thick dough remains.

  4. Place a piece of parchment paper on a kitchen surface. Place the ball of dough onto it, and lightly flatten. Place the second piece of parchment paper on top. Using a rolling pin, roll out the dough until flat and thin, around 1/6 inch.

  ## Flavor Variations


  * **Nacho Cheese**– Sub out 1/4 cup of the mozzarella cheese with pepper jack cheese or Colby cheese. 

  * **Cool Ranch**– Sprinkle salt, garlic powder, onion powder, and garlic powder. 

  * **Spicy Nachos**– Add cayenne pepper to the dough and sprinkle the cooked chips with a mix of paprika and sea salt.

  * **Lime and Black Pepper**– Add some lime juice to the dough and sprinkle with lemon pepper seasoning. 

  * **Cinnamon Sugar Pita Chip**s- Mix some cinnamon and monk fruit sweetener or erythritol into the dough. Once the tortilla chips are cooked, sprinkle more cinnamon over the tops. 


  ## How to store keto chips


  Homemade keto chips must be stored in a sealed container, at room temperature. They will keep fresh for at least 1 week, usually longer.


   I don’t recommend refrigerating or freezing the chips, as it will no longer have a crispy crunchy texture.
