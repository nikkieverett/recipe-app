directions: 'preheat oven to 350°f.
prepare cake according to the instructions and ingredients listed on the box. beat on medium speed until well combined.
bake cake in 9 inch by 13 inch pan for 20-22 minutes. check for doneness by inserting a toothpick into the middle of the cake. if the toothpick comes out clean
 your cake is done. remove from oven and allow to cool for 10 minutes.
to prepare the blueberry sauce
 start by rinsing the berries. in a medium-sized sauce pan
 combine blueberries
 sugar
 flour and water; stir well. cook over medium-high heat until mixture starts to bubble
 stirring often. turn down heat and let simmer to allow the blueberries to soften. cook until sauce thickens; maybe 10-15 minutes. stir often so the bottom does not burn. allow to cool for 20 minutes
 refrigerate if necessary.
while the cake is still warm
 take the end of a wooden spoon or another round object and poke holes all over the top of your cake. allow to cool for another 20 minutes.
prepare the pudding filling by combining cheesecake pudding with milk and whisk until the pudding is dissolved. pour pudding over top of cake
 filling the holes. refrigerate at least 10 minutes until the pudding is firm.
pour blueberry sauce over top of the cake and refrigerate until cake and toppings are cooled.
remove the cream cheese from the refrigerator 15-20 minutes before preparing the whipped topping. at the same time
 put your mixing bowl and wire whisk in the freezer to help it get very cold. this is optional
 but something i usually do.
beat cream cheese on medium-high speed for 2-3 minutes until cream cheese is smooth and free of lumps. scrape down the sides of the bowl occasionally.
add 3 tablespoons of the heavy whipping cream and beat it into the cream cheese until the cream cheese resembles a liquid mixture.
then
 add the remaining heavy whipping cream and beat on medium-high speed. once the cream starts to thicken
 slowly add the powdered sugar and beat until stiff peaks form. spread over cooled cake. this cake must be refrigerated.'
