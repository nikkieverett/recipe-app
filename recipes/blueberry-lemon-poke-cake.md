directions: |-
  * Preheat oven to 350°f
  * Prepare cake according to the instructions and ingredients listed on the box
  * Beat on medium speed until well combined
  * Bake cake in 9 inch by 13 inch pan for 20-22 minutes
  * Check for doneness by inserting a toothpick into the middle of the cake (if the toothpick comes out clean your cake is done)
  * Remove from oven and allow to cool for 10 minutes

  To prepare the blueberry sauce
  * Start by rinsing the berries
  * In a medium-sized sauce pan combine blueberries, sugar, flour and water; stir well
  * Cook over medium-high heat until mixture starts to bubble, stirring often
  * Turn down heat and let simmer to allow the blueberries to soften
  * Cook until sauce thickens; maybe 10-15 minutes
  * Stir often so the bottom does not burn
  * Allow to cool for 20 minutes, refrigerate if necessary
  * while the cake is still warm take the end of a wooden spoon or another round object and poke holes all over the top of your cake
  * Allow to cool for another 20 minutes

  To prepare the pudding filling
  * Combine cheesecake pudding with milk and whisk until the pudding is dissolved
  * Pour pudding over top of cake, filling the holes
  * Refrigerate at least 10 minutes until the pudding is firm
  * Pour blueberry sauce over top of the cake and refrigerate until cake and toppings are cooled
  * Remove the cream cheese from the refrigerator 15-20 minutes before preparing the whipped topping
  * At the same time put your mixing bowl and wire whisk in the freezer to help it get very cold (this is optional but something I usually do)
  * Beat cream cheese on medium-high speed for 2-3 minutes until cream cheese is smooth and free of lumps
  * Scrape down the sides of the bowl occasionally
  * Add 3 tablespoons of the heavy whipping cream and beat it into the cream cheese until the cream cheese resembles a liquid mixture
  * Then add the remaining heavy whipping cream and beat on medium-high speed
  * Once the cream starts to thicken slowly add the powdered sugar and beat until stiff peaks form
  * Spread over cooled cake
