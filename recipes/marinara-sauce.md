  **P﻿eel tomatoes**


  ### 1: **Boil Water & Prepare Ice Bath**


  Bring a large pot of water to a boil. Meanwhile, prepare an ice bath by filling a large bowl with cold water and plenty of ice cubes.


  ### 2: **Prep the Tomatoes**


  Wash and dry the tomatoes and remove any stems. Use a paring knife to cut a small, shallow X on the bottom of each tomato (the opposite end to the stem end).


  ### 3: **Boil the Tomatoes**


  Once the water has come to a boil, gently lower the tomatoes into the boiling water. Boil the tomatoes for 30 to 60 seconds. Watch carefully as smaller tomatoes will need less time; you don’t want the tomatoes to start cooking. You’ll know the tomatoes are ready to be removed when the flesh starts to wrinkle, and the skin starts to peel away from the flesh. Use a slotted spoon or a strainer to transfer the tomatoes to the prepared ice bath.


  ### **4: Peel the Tomatoes**


  Once the tomatoes have cooled enough to be handled, remove them from the ice bath and peel off the skin. Use your fingers or the blade of a paring knife to help remove the skin in big pieces.
