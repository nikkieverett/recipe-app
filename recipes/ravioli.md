  * Go to website for further pasta making instructions
  * 1 recipe of filling is enough for 4 recipes of pasta (36 ravioli each)
  * The filling can be frozen
directions: |-
  Ravioli filling:
  * Fry the meat in olive oil until well browned. Drain the meat on paper towels
  * When the meat cools a little put it into a large bowl and mix in the chopped spinach, chopped parsley, beaten eggs and the rest of the ingredients, add salt and pepper to taste
  * Put the filling into the food processor bowl and pulse several times until the mixture is fine
  * Return the filling to the mixing bowl and refrigerate (the filling is easier to work with when refrigerated)
  * The filling will give you enough for a double batch -- making about 90 - 100+ ravioli

  Pasta dough:
  * The food processor method
  * Using the metal blade pulse the flour and salt together.
  * Lightly stir the eggs and olive oil in a measuring cup.
  * With the processor running, add the egg/oil mixture all at once through the feed tube until a ball is formed then pulse several times. the dough should be slightly sticky to the touc, and should spring back when you press it.
  * Form the dough into a smooth ball and place on a dough board or tabletop and cover with a bowl for 30 minutes.
  * After 30 minutes you can make the dough into your preferred shape. this is a single batch --youll need to double the dough to use up all of the filling.

  To cook ravioli:
  * Bring a large pot of water to a boil. Salt the water. You want your water as salty as the sea.
  * Add the ravioli in batches. About 10- 12 at a time. Dont overcrowd. Bring the water back to a gentle simmer and cook for about 3-4 minutes. If the ravioli is frozen, cook for an additional minute.
  * Remove with a slotted spoon or spider to a serving dish. Continue cooking the rest of the ravioli. Serve with your favorite sauce or just with extra-virgin olive oil, butter, sea salt, and freshly ground black pepper. Sprinkle with fresh herbs
