notes: 'go to website for further pasta making instructions
1 recipe of filling is enough for 4 recipes of pasta (36 ravioli each)'
directions: 'for the meat ravioli filling
fry the meat in olive oil until well browned. drain the meat on paper towels
when the meat cools a little put it into a large bowl and mix in the chopped spinach. chopped parsley
 beaten eggs and the rest of the ingredients
 add salt and pepper to taste.
put the filling into the food processor bowl and pulse several times until the mixture is fine.
return the filling to the mixing bowl and refrigerate. (the filling is easier to work with when refrigerated.) the filling will give you enough for a double batch -- making about 90 - 100+ ravioli. the filling can be frozen.

pasta dough
the food processor method
using the metal blade pulse the flour and salt together.
lightly stir the eggs and olive oil in a measuring cup.
with the processor running
 add the egg/oil mixture all at once through the feed tube until a ball is formed then pulse several times. the dough should be slightly sticky to the touch and should spring back when you press it.
form the dough into a smooth ball and place on a dough board or tabletop and cover with a bowl for 30 minutes.
after 30 minutes you can make the dough into your preferred shape. this is a single batch --youll need to double the dough to use up all of the filling.

to cook ravioli:
bring a large pot of water to a boil. salt the water. you want your water as salty as the sea.
add the ravioli in batches. about 10- 12 at a time. dont overcrowd. bring the water back to a gentle simmer and cook for about 3-4 minutes. if the ravioli is frozen
 cook for an additional minute.
remove with a slotted spoon or spider to a serving dish. continue cooking the rest of the ravioli. serve with your favorite sauce or just with extra-virgin olive oil
 butter
 sea salt
 and freshly ground black pepper. sprinkle with fresh herbs.'
