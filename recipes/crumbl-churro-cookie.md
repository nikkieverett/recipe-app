  1. Preheat oven to 350°.

  2. While the oven is preheating make the cookie dough. Cream together the butter and sugar until light and fluffy.

  3. Scrape the sides, add in the eggs, and vanilla extract. Beat until mixed.

  4. Scrape the sides and add in the flour, baking powder and cinnamon. Mix until thoroughly combined.

  5. Scoop out 1/3 cup of dough and roll into a ball. Repeat with remaining dough.

  6. Combine the sugar and cinnamon in a bowl, seperate out a few tbsp worth of the cinnamon sugar and reserve it for sprinkling on top of the cookie after frosting.

  7. Roll and press the cinnamon and sugar onto the cookie dough. Flatten the cookie dough gently so it is in the shape of a hockey puck. Repeat with remaining dough.

  8. Arrange 6 cookies per pan. Bake at 350° for 14-17 minutes or until the centers of the cookies have puffed up and are no longer glossy.

  9. while the cookies are cooling, make the frosting, by whipping the butter until smooth.

  10. Add the powdered sugar, one cup at a time, adding a little bit of milk after each cup of powdered sugar to keep the consistency like a thick frosting.

  11. Once you have added all of the powdered sugar, mix in the cinnamon thoroughly.

  12. Add the frosting to a piping bag fit with a large round piping tip or alternatively you can add the frosting to a gallon sized zip top bag, cut the corner of the bag and use it to pipe the frosting onto the warm cookies in a spiral. Start in the center of the cookie and work your way out.

  13. Sprinkle some extra cinnamon and sugar on top- serve warm!
