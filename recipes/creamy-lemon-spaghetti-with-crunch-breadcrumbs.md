notes: I add chicken to this recipe
directions: |-
  * Heat oil in a skillet over medium heat
  * Add breadcrumbs and stir to thoroughly coat the crumbs with the oil
  * Cook over medium heat, stirring frequently, until the crumbs are golden brown, 5 to 7 minutes
  * It will look like nothing is happening for a long time and then all of the sudden they will turn brown
  * It happens quickly, so keep an eye on them
  * Transfer to a bowl and add 1 teaspoon lemon zest, 1 tablespoon parsley, and the grated cheese
  * Stir to combine and season to taste with salt and pepper
  * Set aside
  * Bring a pot of water to a rolling boil, salt it generously and add the pasta
  * While the pasta cooks, wipe out the skillet and bring the cream and cream cheese to a simmer over medium-low heat â€“ making sure to whisk into a smooth mixture
  * Simmer foR about 5 minutes or until it thickens slightly
  * When pasta is just shy of al dente, reserve 1 cup of pasta cooking water, then drain
  * Add the pasta to sauce, along with chicken, lemon juice and the remaining zest and parsley
  * Toss to combine, adding some of the reserved pasta water a little at a time to thin out the sauce, it will continue to thicken as it sits
  * Season to taste with salt and pepper and serve, garnishing with a generous amount of the breadcrumb mixture and reserved parsley
