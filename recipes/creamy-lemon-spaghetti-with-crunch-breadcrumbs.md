directions: 'heat oil in a skillet over medium heat. add breadcrumbs and stir to thoroughly coat the crumbs with the oil. cook over medium heat
 stirring frequently
 until the crumbs are golden brown
 5 to 7 minutes. it will look like nothing is happening for a long time and then all of the sudden they will turn brown. it happens quickly
 so keep an eye on them. transfer to a bowl and add 1 teaspoon lemon zest
 1 tablespoon parsley
 and the grated cheese. stir to combine and season to taste with salt and pepper. set aside.

bring a pot of water to a rolling boil
 salt it generously and add the pasta.

while the pasta cooks
 wipe out the skillet and bring the cream and cream cheese to a simmer over medium-low heat â€“ making sure to whisk into a smooth mixture. simmer for about 5 minutes or until it thickens slightly.

when pasta is just shy of al dente
 reserve 1 cup of pasta cooking water
 then drain.

add the pasta to sauce
 along with chicken
 lemon juice and the remaining zest and parsley. toss to combine
 adding some of the reserved pasta water
 a little at a time
 to thin out the sauce
