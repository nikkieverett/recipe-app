ingredients: >-
  * 260 g whole milk (9.2 oz.)

  * 60 g white granulated sugar, divided (2.1 oz.)

  * 2 large egg yolks, at **room temperature**

  * 25 g cornstarch, *sifted* (0.9 oz.)

  * 20 g unsalted butter, cut into small pieces and **cold** (0.7 oz.)

  * 1 teaspoon vanilla extract

  * 350 g puff pastry (ready rolled pastry sheet) (12.3 oz.), *thawed but still cold*

  * **For the topping *(optional)***

  * 1 large egg, *slightly beaten with a fork*

  * granulated sugar, *for sprinkling*
directions: >-
  1. **Preparing the pastry cream:** Pour the **milk** into a small pot and add
  about a third of the **sugar**. Heat over medium-high heat until just
  simmering.

  2. Meanwhile, whisk the **egg yolks** with the remaining **sugar** in a medium-sized bowl until combined. ***Tip:** Whisk as soon as you add the sugar to the egg yolks to prevent lumps from forming.*

  3. Add the sifted **cornstarch** and whisk once more to combine. *If you find the mixture thick you can use a spoon instead of a whisk for this step.*

  4. **Tempering the eggs:** Gradually add the hot milk to the egg mixture, whisking constantly. *Don’t pour all the liquid at once. We want to slowly raise the temperature of the eggs without cooking them.*

  5. Pour the mixture back into the pot and cook over medium heat (for about 5 minutes), whisking constantly. Once the foam subsides and the cream starts to thicken, keep an eye out for bubbles forming. When this happens, keep heating for 1-2 more minutes to get rid of any starchy taste. *If the cream is starting to stick to the pot or you notice lumps forming, reduce the heat.*

  6. Remove from the heat and whisk in the **cold butter**. Add the **vanilla extract** and whisk until completely smooth and glossy.

  7. Transfer to a wide container (to cool down quickly). Press a piece of parchment paper onto the surface of the cream to prevent a film from forming.

  8. Let it cool down briefly at room temperature (about 10 minutes) then **chill** for at least an hour or until cold.

  9. **Preparing the pastry cones**: Preheat the oven to 170°C/338°F, convection setting (or 190°C/374°F, conventional setting). Line a baking sheet with parchment paper and set aside.

  10. Carefully unroll the **puff pastry** and place it back on the paper that was used to wrap it (or parchment paper). If needed, gently roll it out with a rolling pin to flatten it evenly. **Tip:** If the puff pastry starts to crack, it’s probably too cold. Let it warm up at room temperature a little before using it. If it is sticky and hard to handle at any point, return it to the refrigerator.

  11. Using a sharp knife, divide the dough (along the long edge) into equally sized strips, about 2.5 cm (1 inch) each.

  12. Place a strip (smoother side out) on the tip of a cream horn mold (pointy side) and lightly press it so it sticks. *The bottom side of the pastry sheet (touching the wrapping paper) will probably be smoother than the top side.*

  13. Then carefully wrap the dough around the mold, slightly overlapping it. Gently press the edge onto the mold. *See pictures in the post for a visual.* Repeat with the remaining molds. *See notes if you don’t have enough molds.*

  14. **Optional:** Brush with the **beaten** **egg** (avoiding the mold) and sprinkle with **granulated** **sugar**. ***Tip:** When applying egg wash, it’s best to do it over a small bowl to catch drips (not over the baking sheet).*

  15. Place on prepared baking sheet, pastry seam side down so that it doesn’t unfold. *If your kitchen is very warm, it’s best to chill the pastries for about 10 minutes before baking them to ensure they puff up properly.*

  16. **Bake** until puffy and golden, about 18 minutes. Let them cool down slightly at room temperature, about 10 minutes, before unmolding. *If the pastry won’t release easily, gently twist the cone mold whilst pulling the pastry.*

  17. Place on a wire rack to cool down completely before filling with cream.

  18. **Filling the cones:** Take the pastry cream out of the fridge and transfer to a mixing bowl. Whip using a hand mixer for 1-2 minutes to loosen.

  19. Fill a piping bag fitted with a large tip with pastry cream. Pipe cream into the pastry cones just before serving and enjoy!
