  ### Instructions


  * Preheat oven to 425 degrees and defrost puff pastry according to the package instructions.

  * Make the sausage mixture by combining all filling ingredients in a medium sized bowl. Set aside.

  * Slightly roll out the puff pastry sheets on a floured surface so it gets thinned out a little more. Cut the puff pastry into three long rectangles (I just slice them at the seams).

  * Create sausage logs by rolling portions with your hands and line them in the center of the puff pastry rectangles, from end to end. Fold over the excess puff pastry and press closed, crimping with a fork to seal in the sausage.

  * Divide into 6 equal pieces per log, about 2" pieces. Diagonally slice the tops 2-3 times with a knife to vent.

  * Place sausage rolls on a baking sheet two inches apart and spread the tops of each sausage roll with egg wash (1 egg whisked with 1 tablespoon water).

  * Bake in a preheated oven for 20 minutes or until the sausage rolls are golden brown and crispy, rotating the pan half way through. While they bake, mix together the honey mustard in a small bowl for dipping.
