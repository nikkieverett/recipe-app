  5. Preheat oven to 400 degrees.  

  6. Ladle 1 cup of the sauce in a 9 x 13 baking dish. 

  7. D﻿ip tortillas into sauce. Sprinkle cheese down the center of each tortilla. Roll the tortilla and place it seam side down into baking dish.  Pour the rest of the sauce all over the enchiladas. Sprinkle with any remaining cheese. 

  8. Bake for 10-14 minutes, or until cheese is melted and it is bubbling and hot.  Top with chopped onions and cilantro, if desired.
