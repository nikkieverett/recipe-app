ingredients: |-
  * 1 unit Mandarin Orange
  * 1.5 ounce Sesame Dressing
  * 1 ounce Sweet Thai Chili Sauce
  * 10 ounce Chicken Cutlets
  * 1 teaspoon Garlic Powder
  * 1 package of sesame salad mix
  * 1 teaspoon sugar
  * Salt / pepper
  * Sesame oil for cooking
directions: >-
  1. Wash and dry produce. • Zest mandarin until you have ¼ tsp (1⁄3 tsp for 4
  servings); peel and dice fruit into bite-size pieces. • In a small bowl,
  combine sesame dressing, chili sauce, and mandarin zest. Season with a pinch
  of salt and pepper.

  2. Heat a large, preferably nonstick, pan over medium-high heat. Add cashews, 1 tsp sugar (2 tsp for 4 servings), and 1 TBSP water (2 TBSP water for 4). Cook, stirring often, until water has evaporated and cashews are coated and lightly toasted, 3-5 minutes. • Turn off heat; transfer to a second small bowl. Wipe out pan.

  3. Pat chicken* dry with paper towels. Season all over with garlic powder, salt, and pepper. • Heat a drizzle of oil in pan used for cashews over medium-high heat. Add chicken and cook until browned and cooked through, 3-5 minutes per side. • Remove from pan; transfer to a cutting board to rest.

  4. In a large bowl, toss spinach, red cabbage and carrot mix, and half the mandarin with half the dressing. • Thinly slice chicken crosswise. • Divide salad between bowls. Top with chicken, candied cashews, and remaining mandarin. Drizzle with remaining dressing and serve.
