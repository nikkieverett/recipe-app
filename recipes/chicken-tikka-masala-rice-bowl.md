href: https://www.hellofresh.com/recipes/chicken-tikka-masala-rice-bowl-61d4c62508030b0f530b5cb2
ingredients: |-
  * ½ cup Basmati Rice
  * 1 unit Roma Tomato
  * 2 Green onion
  * ¼ ounce Cilantro
  * 10 ounce Chicken Breast Strips
  * 1 tablespoon Curry Powder
  * 5 ounce Curry Base Sauce
  * 5 teaspoon White Wine Vinegar
  * ¾ teaspoon Sugar
directions: >-
  1. In a small pot, combine rice, ¾ cup water (1½ cups for 4 servings), and a
  pinch of salt. Bring to a boil, then cover and reduce to a low simmer. Cook
  until rice is tender, 15-18 minutes. • Keep covered off heat until ready to
  serve. • While rice cooks, wash and dry produce. • Dice tomato. Halve, peel,
  and thinly slice half the onion (all for 4). Roughly chop cilantro.

  2. Pat chicken* dry with paper towels; season all over with curry powder, salt, and pepper. • Heat a drizzle of oil in a large pan over medium-high heat. Add chicken; cook, stirring occasionally, until browned and cooked through, 4-6 minutes. • Reduce heat to medium. Stir in tomato and curry sauce base. Bring to a simmer and cook, stirring occasionally, until tomato softens and curry thickens slightly, 3-5 minutes. • Remove from heat.

  3. Fluff rice with a fork. • Divide rice between shallow bowls or plates. Top with chicken tikka. Garnish with pickled onion (draining first) and mango chutney. Drizzle with yogurt, sprinkle with remaining cilantro, and serve.
