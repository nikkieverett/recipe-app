notes: 'this needs to steam longer than instructions say'
directions: 'fill a steamer pot with a few inches of water
 and place a steamer basket on top. cover the pot and bring the water to a boil. turn the heat to low and let it simmer.
use a chef's knife to cut off about 1-inch from the top of each artichoke
 and enough off of the bottom to form a nice base. remove any especially tough outer leaves and discard them. then use kitchen scissors to cut off the sharp tips of the leaves.
using your hands
 carefully pull the leaves away from the middle of the artichoke -- just enough so that you can see down to the choke. now use a spoon to reach down and gently scrape away and discard all of the fuzz
 to reveal a clean heart. (see below image.) drizzle about 1 tablespoon of the lemon juice over each one.
place the artichokes
 stem-end up
 in the steamer basket
 cover
 and steam until they are almost as tender as you like them
 about 20 minutes. (they'll finish cooking in the oven.) check for doneness by pulling off an outer leaf — it should come off fairly easily. set them aside to cool.
while the artichokes are steaming
 preheat the oven to 375 degrees f.
melt the butter in a large sauté pan over low-medium heat. let it simmer until it begins to brown
 about 3 minutes. add the shallots and garlic and cook until soft
 about 3 minutes. pour in about ⅓ cup of lemon juice and the wine. stir and let this simmer on low heat for about 4 minutes. add the bread crumbs and parsley
 stir to blend and remove from the heat. season to taste with salt and pepper (here's how)
 and set aside to cool.
place the artichokes
 sitting on their bases
 in a baking dish.
use a spoon and/or your hands to carefully fill the center of each artichoke with the stuffing -- fill it to maximum capacity! then fill all of the spaces between the leaves as much as possible. sprinkle the top of each one with about half of the parmesan.
place the stuffed artichokes in the preheated 375 degree f oven and bake until the breadcrumbs are golden and the cheese has melted
 15 to 20 minutes.
you can serve them whole as an entrée
 or slice them in half for an appetizer.'
