directions: |-
  * In medium bowl, mix 1 cup flour and the salt
  * Cut in shortening, using pastry blender (or pulling 2 table knives through ingredients in opposite directions), until particles are size of small peas
  sprinkle with cold water, 1 tablespoon at a time, tossing with fork until all flour is moistened and pastry almost leaves side of bowl (1 to 2 teaspoons more water can be added if necessary)
  * Gather pastry into a ball
  * Shape into flattened round on lightly floured surface
  * Wrap flattened round of pastry in plastic wrap, and refrigerate about 45 minutes or until dough is firm and cold, yet pliable
  * This allows the shortening to become slightly firm, which helps make the baked pastry more flaky
  * If refrigerated longer, let pastry soften slightly before rolling
  * Heat oven to 400°f
  * On surface sprinkled with flour, using floured rolling pin, roll pastry dough into circle 2 inches larger than 9-inch pie plate
  * Fold pastry into fourths; place in pie plate
  * Unfold and ease into plate, pressing firmly against bottom and side and being careful not to stretch pastry, which will cause it to shrink when baked
  * Trim overhanging edge of pastry 1 inch from rim of pie plate
  * Fold and roll pastry under, even with plate; flute as desired
  * In large bowl, toss filling ingredients
  * Pour into pie plate, mounding apples toward center
  * In medium bowl, use pastry blender or fingers to mix butter, 1 cup flour and the brown sugar until a crumb forms
  * Sprinkle evenly over top of pie
  * Sprinkle 1 tablespoon granulated sugar on top
  * Bake 45 to 55 minutes or until pie crust and crumb topping are deep golden brown and filling begins to bubble
  * Transfer to cooling rack to cool
