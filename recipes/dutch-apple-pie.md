 tossing with fork until all flour is moistened and pastry almost leaves side of bowl (1 to 2 teaspoons more water can be added if necessary). gather pastry into a ball. shape into flattened round on lightly floured surface. wrap flattened round of pastry in plastic wrap
 and refrigerate about 45 minutes or until dough is firm and cold
 yet pliable. this allows the shortening to become slightly firm
 which helps make the baked pastry more flaky. if refrigerated longer
 let pastry soften slightly before rolling.

 using floured rolling pin
 roll pastry dough into circle 2 inches larger than 9-inch pie plate. fold pastry into fourths; place in pie plate. unfold and ease into plate

 even with plate; flute as desired.
