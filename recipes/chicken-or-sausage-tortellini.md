notes: 'keep an eye on your tortellini; it may be done sooner
if still soupy
 leave lid off for the last half hour or so of cooking'
directions: 'this recipes calls for sausage but chicken sausage is good too.
the only prep work is to brown your sausage; whichever kind you choose for extra flavor
put all ingredients in crockpot
 chunking up the cream cheese
cook on low for 4-6 hrs.'
ingredients: '1 (19oz) bag of frozen cheese tortellini

1 lb. of ground sausage or chicken/turkey sausage
