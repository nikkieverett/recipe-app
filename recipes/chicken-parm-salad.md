href: https://www.hellofresh.com/recipes/chicken-parm-salad-42-59b9a8caad1d6c5aea5502d2
ingredients: |-
  * 12 ounce Yukon Gold Potatoes
  * ¼ cup Panko Breadcrumbs
  * ¼ cup Parmesan Cheese
  * 1 teaspoon Garlic Powder
  * 12 ounce Chicken Breasts
  * 3 tablespoon Sour Cream
  * 1 unit Lemon
  * 5 ounce Spinach
directions: >-
  1. Wash and dry all produce. Preheat oven to 450 degrees. Cut potatoes into
  ¾-inch cubes. Toss on a baking sheet with a drizzle of olive oil and a large
  pinch of salt and pepper. Roast in oven until lightly browned and tender,
  about 25 minutes, tossing halfway through.

  2. Meanwhile, combine ¼ cup panko (we sent more), Parmesan, garlic powder, and a pinch of salt and pepper in a small bowl.

  3. Place a chicken breast between two pieces of plastic wrap. Pound with a rolling pin, mallet, or heavy-bottomed pan until ½ inch thick. Season with salt and pepper. Repeat with remaining chicken breast.

  4. Place chicken breasts on a lightly oiled baking sheet and brush tops with 2 TBSP sour cream (we’ll be using more later). Press crust mixture into sour cream. Bake in oven until chicken is cooked through and crust is crispy, 12-15 minutes.

  5. Halve lemon. Cut one half into wedges. In a large bowl, combine 1 TBSP sour cream (you’ll have some left over), a large drizzle of olive oil, a squeeze of lemon juice, and a pinch of salt and pepper. When potatoes are done, add to bowl along with spinach and toss to coat evenly. Season with salt and pepper.

  6. Divide salad between plates and top with chicken. Serve with lemon wedges on the side for squeezing over.
