ingredients: |-
  * 2 sheets puff pastry thawed
  * 9 slices bacon par cooked, chopped
  * onion jam (recipe below)
  * 1/2 cup cheddar cheese sharp, aged, mature cheddar
  * 1 egg

    ## Balsamic Onion Jam

    * 1﻿lb onions
    * 1.5 T butter
    * 1/4 c sugar 
    * 1/8 c balsamic vinegar 
    * p﻿inch of thyme, salt and pepper
directions: >-
  1. Preheat your oven to 400-F (200 C).

  2. M﻿ake onion jam - Slice sweet onions and cook them with butter in a large skillet over low heat until they’re soft, dark golden brown, and caramelized.

  3. Sprinkle sugar over the top and let it cook without stirring, to dissolve.

  4. Add balsamic vinegar to the onions and sugar and mix well.

  5. Simmer over medium-low heat until the onions are thick and jammy and most of the vinegar has evaporated.

  6. Add a pinch of thyme, salt and pepper, and let cool before using.

  7. While onion jam is cooking, partially cook the bacon so that it is cooked but still limp. You don't want it too brown or crisp or it'll overcook in the oven.  

  8. Lay the puff pastry on a work surface and cut it into 8 squares equal-sized squares or rectangles.

  9. Spread about a tablespoon (15 mL) of onion jam on the puff pasty in a thin line from one corner to the other

  10. Sprinkle about 2 tablespoons (30 mL) of cheddar on top of the onion jam.

  11. Lay bacon crumbles on top of the cheddar. 

  12. Fold the turnover by lifting one of the empty corners and laying it over the bacon, then lift the opposite corner over and press it down onto the first corner to create a turnover.

  13. Brush the top of the pastry with egg wash and lay them on a parchment paper-lined baking sheet.

  14. Bake in a preheated 400-F (200 C) oven for about 20 minutes or until puffed up, lightly golden brown, and flaky.

  15. Let cool then dig in!
