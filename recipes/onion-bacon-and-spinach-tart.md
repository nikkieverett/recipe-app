  3. Return skillet to medium heat and add onions, 1/4 teaspoon salt and the thyme. Cover and cook 25 minutes over medium heat, stirring occasionally, or until browned. Remove from heat and allow to cool, uncovered, 5 minutes. 

  4. Whisk together eggs, half-and-half, pepper and the remaining 1/2 teaspoon salt. Stir bacon mixture and onions into eggs; stir to combine. Pour egg mixture into crust. Bake at 375 degrees F for 15 minutes. Reduce heat to 325 degrees F and continue to bake 20 minutes.
