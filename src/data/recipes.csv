","preheat oven to 350 degrees. spray a mini muffin pan with cooking spray.
in a small mixing bowl, combine graham cracker crumbs, flour, baking soda, and salt. stir with a wire whisk. set aside.
in larger bowl, with a handheld electric mixer, blend the butter, brown sugar, and sugar until creamy and combined.
add in egg and vanilla extract. mix well.
dump in the bowl of dry ingredients, mix on low speed just until combined. the dough will be crumbly.
scoop dough into the mini muffin tins. fill them full and press down slightly so the dough is even on top. you will have the perfect amount of dough to fill all 24 mini muffin tins.

bake for 8 minutes. they will look like they're not done, but trust me, they'll be perfect.

immediately after baking, take a teaspoon size measuring spoon and press into the dough. you want to make an indent for the marshmallow to sit in. place a half of marshmallow into each indent in the muffin cups. sticky side of the marshmallow down.
let cool for 20 minutes.
place one square of chocolate on top of each marshmallow.
turn the oven broiler to high. place muffin tin pan under the broiler for 1-2 minutes. watch carefully. this toasts the marshmallows fast.

let cool for about 10 minutes and eat right away for a warm, gooey s'more or let cool completely.

** if you don't want the chocolate very melted (like what is pictured) broil the pan with the marshmallows first, and then immediately after taking out of the oven, press one chocolate on top of each toasted marshmallow. the chocolate is more of a softer chocolate that retains it's shape almost perfectly when you do it this way. i have made these both ways and either way is delicious.**

use a chef's knife to cut off about 1-inch from the top of each artichoke, and enough off of the bottom to form a nice base. remove any especially tough outer leaves and discard them. then use kitchen scissors to cut off the sharp tips of the leaves.
using your hands, carefully pull the leaves away from the middle of the artichoke -- just enough so that you can see down to the choke. now use a spoon to reach down and gently scrape away and discard all of the fuzz, to reveal a clean heart. (see below image.) drizzle about 1 tablespoon of the lemon juice over each one.
place the artichokes, stem-end up, in the steamer basket, cover, and steam until they are almost as tender as you like them, about 20 minutes. (they'll finish cooking in the oven.) check for doneness by pulling off an outer leaf — it should come off fairly easily. set them aside to cool.
while the artichokes are steaming, preheat the oven to 375 degrees f.
melt the butter in a large sauté pan over low-medium heat. let it simmer until it begins to brown, about 3 minutes. add the shallots and garlic and cook until soft, about 3 minutes. pour in about ⅓ cup of lemon juice and the wine. stir and let this simmer on low heat for about 4 minutes. add the bread crumbs and parsley, stir to blend and remove from the heat. season to taste with salt and pepper (here's how), and set aside to cool.
place the artichokes, sitting on their bases, in a baking dish.
use a spoon and/or your hands to carefully fill the center of each artichoke with the stuffing -- fill it to maximum capacity! then fill all of the spaces between the leaves as much as possible. sprinkle the top of each one with about half of the parmesan.

when the meat cools a little put it into a large bowl and mix in the chopped spinach. chopped parsley, beaten eggs and the rest of the ingredients, add salt and pepper to taste. 
put the filling into the food processor bowl and pulse several times until the mixture is fine. 
return the filling to the mixing bowl and refrigerate. (the filling is easier to work with when refrigerated.) the filling will give you enough for a double batch -- making about 90 - 100+ ravioli. the filling can be frozen. 

pasta dough
the food processor method
using the metal blade pulse the flour and salt together.
lightly stir the eggs and olive oil in a measuring cup.
with the processor running, add the egg/oil mixture all at once through the feed tube until a ball is formed then pulse several times. the dough should be slightly sticky to the touch and should spring back when you press it. 
form the dough into a smooth ball and place on a dough board or tabletop and cover with a bowl for 30 minutes.
after 30 minutes you can make the dough into your preferred shape. this is a single batch --you'll need to double the dough to use up all of the filling.

to cook ravioli:
bring a large pot of water to a boil. salt the water. you want your water as salty as the sea.
add the ravioli in batches. about 10- 12 at a time. don't overcrowd. bring the water back to a gentle simmer and cook for about 3-4 minutes. if the ravioli is frozen, cook for an additional minute.

combine flour, baking powder, baking soda and salt in a bowl and whisk to blend. in a large bowl or the bowl of a stand mixer, beat cream cheese, butter and sugar until fluffy. add egg and extracts and blend again. add flour mixture and beat just until flour disappears. in some cases, this dough will feel too soft to roll into balls in your hands; if so, let it chill in the fridge for 20 minutes or so before using.

scoop balls of dough — i like these cookies best with a #40, or 1 1/2 tablespoon, scoop; the texture is less dynamic when made smaller — and roll them briefly in the palms of your hands before dropping them in a bowl of rainbow sprinkles and gently rolling to coat them evenly. i find that the sprinkles adhere much better to tacky exterior of balls of dough that have been briefly warmed by your hands — trust me here.

transfer balls of sprinkle-coated dough to baking sheets at least two inches apart. use the bottom of a drinking glass to press down on the cookies until they are about 1/4 to 1/2-inch tall. if you see any bare spots in the sprinkles that bother you, you can sprinkle a few more on top. bake for 9 to 10 minutes until they look underbaked but lightly golden underneath.
